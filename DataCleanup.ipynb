First of all, you can do a running or a little more speedy walking for your health after working or attending school even for a few minutes sometimes in a week. Another things in order for you to keep healty are to cut over-eating in every diet.

The most keen i want to tell you at this moment, therefore, is this that , at any time, you should keep on having a mind that your health is made by you, not innate. A great song , I like it by De Barge , was remixed by a lot of musicians, but this remixed song by Jazztronik is so good !! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5clZm_eo6o\n",

      "textContent--->Essay 11: Which should schools emphasis more, competition or cooperation? We need to spark students’ interest in each subject rather than compare with each other in the first place. We tend to be good at those which we like. Students will get more involved in learning when they find out what they really like. Competition can improve academic ability to some degree, but it has limitations. To compare with someone might make student lose confidence and even hate studying. On the other hand, students will be able to lift their self-esteem when they work hard for their own goal by cooperating. It was fun for me to solve questions arguing with my friends in my school days. Those memories last long and so does knowledge. At school they should pay more attention to foster a love of learning and nurture self-control.\n",

But, for me, though I might hear her feeling, it begins to seem too green. She said, “There must be some treatment to make celery too green. I do not like this.” So, we became a little nervous for the starter. Anyway, dished are delicious. I could have known Shanghai’s dishes are not hot and simple, but tasty.\n",

      "textContent--->For the next TOEIC Ever since one of my goals, which I got over 800 on the TOEIC test, was achieved, I've not taken the test and focused on my work or daily routine study of English. However, I think I'll take it next year. In fact, I was supposed to take it this year, but I didn't managed to do because I was up to my neck in my lessons, training lessons for teachers and advertisement for my class room etc. Last time, I didn't consider my plans to take the test, but I'll be apparently required to study for it because I'm shooting for around 900. It's said some of questions are so tricky that those who want to make a high score should find their weak points and review them in detail or English grammar. They should not only review, but they're also better off getting the knack of answering the questions within a time limit. I'm not good at dissect my last score or weak points, nor think up I the best tactics. But I'll make all-out efforts... These kinds of efforts might lead to beef up my overall English ability. :D Anyway, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, everyone!!\n",

      "textContent--->On Yomi and Kun Yomi 音On is the Chinese ways of reading for the Kanji and 訓 Kun is Japanese ways of reading for it. On means sound. Kun means knowing something. Kunwa (訓話) A story to know something good. 社長訓話 President Speech Kanji mean Han Dynasty’s letters 206BC – 220AD, irrespective of when they were created in China and when imported from China to Japan. Japan dispatched students to China each era when China flourished where Chinese culture flourished. They brought Kanji back with their pronunciations of times and of places, of course philosophies of them were main purposes. There are three main 音On as an example 行:おこなう・ゆく（Kun） Go On （呉音）is pronunciation in 400AD -600AD 行政　ぎょう・せい Administration Kan On （漢音）is pronunciation in 600AD – 800AD 行為 こう・い Action Tou On （唐音）is pronunciation in 1200AD – 1400AD 行脚 あん・ぎゃ　Travelling around for Buddhism Purpose 唐(Tang) is not related to Tang Dynasty 600AD - 900D itself directly. 唐 means just China. 呉and漢 are also the same. You have to remember Kanji idioms one by one with pronunciation because there are no grammatical reasons. 「行政」is Gyousei and 「行為」is Koui as if they were one letter. However, you can imagine that it means something with action in seeing 行. China was not one nation. It was like Europe. Chinese languages were quit different from each other as German and French were different, but they were called Chinese as if German and French were called one European language. Chinese letters are like pictures. If you draw HEAD, this picture or letter means head. If you show it to a German, he would understand that it is head, but he would pronounce it as Kopf. Chinese in Japanese is like Latin or French in English. Buy is Kun Yomi and Procure is On Yomi.\n",

They did so mostly because of their parents' overseas assignments. They can speak both Japanese and English very fluently without any effort since these languages are their native languages. Speaking two or more languages is natural for them. I can’t speak English well like them, so I really admire their abilities. On the other hand, there are a lot of learners who try to speak English. They are highly motivated to study English. Some of them study English for a few hours per day. I’m lazy, so I can’t do so. I really respect their eagerness. I’m very happy since there are a lot of people who I can admire or respect in the world.\n",

They've experienced a hard time till this World Cup. Japanese women are short compared to the other countries' so often kicked or pushed down in games and lost many times. To make matters worse, women's soccer had little fans so they weren't able to get enough money from the authorities. However, they are strong. While in the lack of money, they practiced very hard so that they can compete for the ball against Western players. In 2004, when the nickname \"Nadeshiko Japan\" (\"Nadeshiko\" is a kind of dianthus, and the nickname comes from the phrase \"Yamato Nadeshiko\"(大和撫子, \"ideal Japanese woman\") had been popular, the team was starting to get wins. The rank has been up and now it is #4 in the world. So the time has come. The time the Japanese will get the top of the world. Since March 11th of this year, Japan has experienced a hard time.

This summer, in Japan,we are trying not to use much energy. As you know,Japan had been struck by very big earthquake in March, and the big problem happened at Fukushima energy plant. All Japanese people are concerned about radiation leak, and many people asked the goverment to stop making energy at nuclear power plants. The prefecture where I live has the most nuclear power plants and some of them doesn't work now. This is very difficult problem for us. Certainly,it is very dengerous, but it may be difficult to stop working them right away  because Japan rely on nuclear power for many part of electric suply. However,We must decide whether we use nuclear power plant in future. I think it is our generations who decide it. So younger peopole in Japan should have more interest in these problem or  politics. What do you think about a nucler poower plant? Please let me your opinion.\n",

      "textContent--->Alt guide of Japan 30 faux pas 6 Again, Japan`s turn. I`ve heard many times that the Japanese language(NipponGo 日本語) is a vague language from the Westerner`s point of view. I don`t know the truth of it, because I really don`t know other of this planet`s languages, I only know a little English. A science-like topic said that NipponGo is a synthetic language, of course the great English is analytic language... I don`t understand  what the topic said, I simply got the impression that NipponGo was inferior than what they spoke. Is there any rational reason that many western people have such an impression about NipponGo? In my opinion, the Japanese language has an unfamilar face to Westerners, because of Kanji characters. \"A\" is a just single sign in the alphabet. The four characters of W,O,R and D makes \"word\" in English. This  looks simple. Only 26 characters produce all English words. On the other hand, Hiragana, Katakana and RomaJi(roman letters spelling) are all signs like an alphabet. However, most Kanji are not simple signs but symbols. Therefore, regular Kana and Kanji mixed in the Japanese that we commonly write and speak, which is (in a sense) similar to building construction by assembling many symbolic parts. Nippon or Nihon is just a name of some nation that also known as Japan. But, as for 日本, two Kanji character each has it`s own symbolic meaning of, 日, the Sun. 本, base, genuine, essence and book. So, the combined word 日本 has a meaning of \" The place where the Sun rises\". So, if I say so myself, \"Japan\" is not equal to \"日本” for Japanese people. Every country can see the sunrise, Of course. This was the reason why our ancestor named Nihon to this islands. 続く\n",

      "textContent--->We need English as official language? Recently two Japanese companies, UNIQLO and Rakuten, decided to change their official language from Japanese to English. They plan to expand their business overseas. They think if they continue to use Japanese as official language, they can't employ overseas people that can't speak Japanese but have excellent skills. Furthermore, Rakuten intends to sack the corporate officers if they will not learn English until two years later. The employees that can't use English also will be reduced. I heard that now they use English at meetings even though all attendees are Japanese. Some Japanese bloggers say that it's the excellent decision because Japanese employees will be able to communicate with overseas employees and customers more easily than before if they will learn English. Usually overseas people can understand English even if they're not from English-speaking countries. On the other hands, there are people that criticize it. Some of them say that not all employees need to use English. Even the employees that have high English skills can't convey detailed intentions in English as well as in Japanese. Japanese employee will not be able to communicate well each other. It will bring adverse effect. I totally agree an opinion that English is important for communication. I work only in Japan, but sometimes I need to use English. It is necessary for me, and much more for people that work at global companies. However, I wonder that they really need to change the official language while going out of their way to sack or reduce employees and to talk in English among Japanese employees. How do you think about it?\n",

Actually I wanted to go out and exercise, but it was cold outside and I have allergy to pollen, so I spent my time inside.

It is a collection of 12 short stories, and I finished reading first story and the middle of second one. The author is Jeffery Deaver, which is probably popular because I found this book in the top seller ranking of Amazon. It’s not so difficult that I recommend you to read it. After lunch, I watched glee and Veronica Mars on DVD. Needless to say about glee, Veronica Mars is also a good work. Heroine is the high school girl named Veronica. Her friend was killed by someone, and Veronica starts looking for the murder. Um…I have never watched all yet, so if you get interested in it, check it out! In addition, I rented DVDs of Lost, Numbers, and Lie to me. I will watch these DVDs this weekend. Which series do you like? Tomorrow, I’m going to attend the lecture of the president of my university. The lecture seldom takes places, so I’m looking forward to it. But I have a problem. I have an allergy to pollens this season. I’m fear of that. I need a mask, eye drops, and some medicine. Anyway, I’m all right thanks to you all. Good nightJ\n",

EMC stands for Electromagnetic Compatibility. Sounds difficult, doesn’t it? I still don’t understand everything. Anyway, today I would like you to correct the work I’ve done before. It might be difficult if you don’t know about the electricity. Sorry! Inductance:　Property of a circuit to oppose a change in current. The moving magnetic field produced by a change in current causes an induced voltage to oppose the original change. A magnetic field is generated when flowing DC to a spirally-coiled conductor. In a moment of the magnetic field formed, the back electro-motive force would be induced in the coil. This phenomenon is called a self-induction-effect. The ratio of this reverse direction voltage is called “Inductance”.\n",

As I love eating eels very much, I was looking forward to this day for a while. I will eat out from now on with my family. We have a very delicious eel's restaurant near our house. We will order the eel which is grilled with special sauce. It covered over the rice with special sauce which flavor is sweet and salty. It is called unajyu(うな重）in Japanese. When it is summer, we tend to be tired because hot with high humidity temperature reduce our power from us. Although it is our habit to eat eels in summer, we believe that we can supplement our power from eating eels and can get over during summer comfortable. This custom started from around 1820's.

      "textContent--->Do the world's wildness should be better protected? I tried to write two essays. I have learned some pattern of essay writings and at the same time I realized I won't write better essay without practice. ********************** Today, we often hear that we should save the world's wildness. I totally agree this idea. Can we protect the world's wildness? I don't think so. First of all, population growth has gratly influenced on the world. We have expanded land since early times but the larger population growth becomes, the more we need to get new land. As a result of this, wildness is decreasing. Futhermore, ecotourism, whose business takes advantage of wildness, may have harmful effects on wildness. People want to enjoy and learn wildness but, ironically, it may damage on the environment. Some people argue ecotourism helps the local people develop economy, but one of the problems is that they may focus too much on their business and they may pay little attention to protect wildness. We tend to pursue our profit, but we should consider future generations. Saving the world's wildness will lead to saving our future generations.\n",
      "textContent--->Talking about a cram shool in Japan. I'm going to talking about education in Japan. Some people in Japan think it's really important to send their children to competitive Kindergartens. So some Japanese children have to go to a cram school. This topic may be a little hard for me. But I wonder that I write down my opinions. ***** I had taken examinations apply to junior high schools and colleges. They were valuable experiences for me. I don't think the examination ordeal is so bad. Because students try to find out efficient ways which they study something with. When they will grow up, it will be useful for their work. By the way, I heard my friend's daughter has attended to a public junior high school. She said she doesn't like her school, though she liked her elementary school. Their surroundings may be bad. It may be important to chose a school. But educations cost a lot of money in Japan, for a private school ,a crammer and so on. I think it is serious problem. I hope that some public schools' qualities are inproved better.\n",

Then, I started searching. First of all. I moved the shelf to see if the key had fallen in the gap between the shelf and wall. But there was nothing. １８：００ There was still no key anywhere. I tried to recall what I did at the previous night. I attended toastmasters’ meeting and then I went to the second party and then I had a third party just short time and went back home around 1130 pm….? You my suspect I was drunk. But believe me, I wasn’t drank much. I drank only a glass of beer and a glass of green tea milk cocktail, only. I swear. １９：００ I got a phone call from my friend. 「You got it?」 「Not yet」 「Do you have any idea about where it is ?」 「No idea」 「Well, I am hungry, so I will start my dinner」 「Sorry」 [Never mind] I missed a special miss-based milk flavor nabe!!! At this stage, I didn’t give up yet. I thought I would make it by dessert time、 So, I got a noodle to recharge energy and started searching again. ２０：００ Tarararattara---- It was sound from TV. It is the time NHK dorama starts I became serious about what was happening “key is missing”. By the way, I don’t have a spare key. I used to have one, but several months ago, there was an incident that one of residents was broken into a stranger when he or she was out. Although there was noting stolen, for the safety concern, all keys of all residents were replaced to new and more complicate one. Since then I don’t have a spare key. On the occasion of the replacement, we were reminded that even only single resident roses a key, all of our keys shall be replaced again because the keys are also used for the key of the building entrance too. The cost may be on you!!!!!!!!!! OH MY god!! ２１：００ There is still no key. I was almost crying. Why nobody helps me even though I was in such a serious trouble. I wish I would lose a mobile phone instead of a door key so that I could call the number and I may know where it is by the ringing sound. Wait… I set it to manner mode always. More than that, I have no phone at home. It doesn’t work….! I was disappointed about myself. I tried to recognize this experience in a positive way. So, I tried to think it may be good idea to use this experience for my next speech because some senior member told me that the episodes especially something you fell must be good contents for the speech, ２２：００ It has already passed the sweet dessert time. It is almost the closure of the day….. However; I still have no idea about the missing key….. I thought I would go out tomorrow without locking the door because I don’t want to ask the building manager for a spare key. I don’t want to let her know I lost a door key…. However, it must not be a good idea, so only option I take is Searing searching searing!!! I decided to do as if it was police investigation. The principle of the investigation--- it is to look into carefully where the incident happened. This case, I must miss the key at the entrance. I again move the shelf and looked at the gap between shelf and wall. But nothing there again. Next I opened and closed the 2 drawler of the shelf,  Open and close, open and close At that time! Careen I hear metallic sound  I cannot believe it !!! The door key was in a very narrow space between the back of shelf and the back of drawler. Last night, when I put the key on the shelf it fell into the gap. Just hall in on! １０：２０ The investigation is done. Ladies and gentlemen, What is important for you? Now I would say it is time especially Time in the weekend. I don’t west your precious time for just searching your key, so  Let me remind you by this key note speech of please taking care of something important for you.\n",

Others believe that young people can teach older people something. Which statement do you agree with and why? Include specific details and examples to support your choice. Answer I believe even though young people can teach older people. Of course, generally speaking, older people know many thing better than young people. On the other hand, young people are superior in certain categories, for example, how to use computers and internet, about subculture, and latest news. These knowledge areas require the young sense and flexible images. Therefore, I believe younger people and older people can teach each other.\n",
      "textContent--->The Phrase That I Had Mistaken For a Long Time Sometimes I wonder about what it would be like, if I started to learn English from the very beginning the way native speakers did. If I did it, I probably wouldn’t wonder about something like this. I had been wondering about why “Stand by me” wasn’t “Stood by me.”  Don’t you understand why I had been wondering about such a thing? I started to learn English by memorizing its grammar in school the way almost Japanese people did. So, probably because of it, I had mistaken it for a while that we should have wrote the verb as past voice automatically, if words like, “by someone” came up. (Should I write this sentence as simple past?) Now I think why I didn’t wonder about why “Stand by me” wasn’t “Being stood by me” or why “Someone is stood by me” in the first place (Is it like a punishment?)  It’s so funny. Even if there are many Japanese people who started to learn English the way I did, people who wonder about the same thing as me might be a few. Don’t worry! Now I understand what “Stand by me” means.\n",

      "textContent--->Japanese-style painting is a dead genre On Dec.2nd one of the most famous Japanese painter HIRAYAMA Ikuo was dead. One of the his work was offered to Yakushi-ji temple in Nara prefecutre, Japan. Yakushi-ji temple is a historical temple. It was built in B. C. 710. Therefore Yakushi-ji temple has a lot of masterpieces in various periods such as sculptures of Budda, picture of goddes and beautiful stupa. When I heard the news that Mr. Hirayama's work was offered to Yakushi-ji, I felt \"Oh my God! In 100 years or so, our descendants will see that picture and think 'Wow, the masterpiece of that time is not so good.' I'm shame of this. He is not representative of our periods.\" I think he is a good painter but not great. I think painting, especially for Japanese-style painting, is a dead genre. Some genre of art is dead when the masterpiece appear and people think any successor can't make better one than it. I think painting was dead at the middle of 20th centuries when Picasso, Gogh or Chirico painted masterpieces. If I could choose some works which is dedicated to Yakushi-ji temple, I would choose works of Modern Art such as Media art, installation and so on. I think these should be representative of our periods. Sculptures of Budda: http://www.nara-yakushiji.com/guide/hotoke/hotoke_toindo.html Picture of Goddes: http://www.nara-yakushiji.com/guide/hotoke/hotoke_etc.html Beautiful Stupa: http://www.nara-yakushiji.com/guide/garan/garan_toto.html\n",

When I was eating, my workmate called me. She asked me what time I would reach to my home. I answered her “I am still in the capital city of Bhutan, so maybe 7 o’clock.” Then she told me that she asks her husband to go here to pick me up by car. I was glad to hear her proposal, because it costs two hundreds Ngultrum from the shop to my assignment place. I gave thanks to her, however my workmate said to me “Ok, but please bring a hamburger to me!” Actually the price of a hamburger was 175 Ngultrum, but I agreed to her. On the way home, her husband and I talked about the difference of Japanese funeral and Bhutanese one. He gave me a fresh apple, so I bought a roast corn in return. It cost 40 Ngultrum. After all, I paid total 210 Ngultrum. When I went home, I felt nostalgia with my home. Here seems to be my second hometown.\n",

XO Because I had recently broken up with my girlfriend who I had been dating for seven years! I had completely trusted her, loved her, but she left me. This situation was really my own fault because I have gone to London by myself for one year. But I said that I wanted to get married soon when I buck to Japan and got a proper job. I can't live without you! She said \"It's too late to turn back. I intend to move forward (separate ways).\" I know what is done cannot be undone. But I don't want to believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. However, after we had parted, I suddenly became uneasy. I still regret the loss of a girlfriend. Then I have a gnawing pain in my stomach. Probably it can be a sign of gastric ulcer.

I think they may be slightly different but almost same. I guess \"think positive\" is \"think a positive thing\" or \"think in a positve way\" in a complete sentence.

Anyhow, I am writing a diary for the first time in one year. I used to keep a diary when I was a high school student, but I quitted. I wrote anything I came up with at that time. It was about a girlfriend , manga, a singer, music, drama,  a girl,etc. I enjoyed writing English and now I still enjoy it. So now, I am going to write about current lifestyle of mine. I can't get up early in the morining at all. I am not an early bird,but the rest of my family are so. I really envy them. I am a collage student ,and so I have to get up in the morining and get ready for school. However, unfortunately, I can't get up at even noon,much less in the morning. What a corrupt life I lead!!!!!!! This is all because autumn came. As some of readers can see, in Japan it is getting colder and colder  little by little now. So it is very comfortable to be in Futon , that is bed in English. It is just warm inside although it is not cold outside of the Futon at all. I love the warm so much. That's why I can't get up . I  am apt to oversleep. That's all for today. Thank you for reading. Catch you later！\n",

I heard \"I can dig it\" and I searched for the meaning of it. According to a website which translates English to Japanese, it means \"わかった。 \" in Japanese. It also says that \"I can dig it\" is a slung.

I think it's a kind of propaganda that U. S. has reduced and he leads another counties how to do over 80% of nukes. Probably Pentagon does not want to explain what does this number mean. Remember, the U. S has developed MIRV (Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle) and has deployed already. That means even ONE ICBM or SLBM can destroy many cities at one time. Why do we need over 5 thousand of them? Are we certainly that total destructive power of nukes has decreased or not? The world has probably not changed. I mean human-being might not be changed. Once we have a tool, we won't miss chances to use. History says so. Okay, keep eyes on those who want use their \"airms\".

Antimoon. com http://www.antimoon.com/ Most of the author's advice and opinions were what I had heard about or read before, but this one was new to me:   \"We can damage our English by writing and speaking incorrectly. Do not write or speak unless you learn to do so correctly by reading and listening much enough. \"  I partially agree with his opinion. I think nothing we first learned can be easily changed whether it is correct or not. Because we intuitively feel so, most of us give up using foreign languages. The author gave up getting things corrected by others. I think it is already out of date. Think about people who correct our native language, they are first our parents, then teachers and classmates, and finally all the other native speakers including ourselves. Now we've got sites like Lang-8, so I think the day has come when we should keep in touch with foreign language advisers, free of charge. I'd like to mention other topics from the site in other entries.\n",
      "textContent--->Do you wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle? In Japan, many people ride bicycles, but almost no one wears a helmet. When I was in Canada, I was surprised that many cyclists wore helmets and rode very fast. Sometimes, I almost collided with them while I walked along the sidewalk. In Japan, most cyclists don’t ride as fast as cyclists in Canada, and they also obey traffic lights. Cyclists are treated as the same as pedestrians in Japan. They ride on the same sidewalks as for pedestrians and usually, they are careful not to bump into them. If you come to Japan and see bicycles parked alongside the road, you may see some differences between your county and ours. Firstly, the most popular bicycles in Japan are the ones for women, called \"Mamachari\"(ママチャリ), although they are ridden by both men and women. They can’t be ridden very fast and they are mainly used for going to work, school, or shopping. Secondly, in Japan, you can park your bicycle in front of shops without paying any fees and without fear of theft. (But you need to lock it.) Everyday, I go to work by bicycle without wearing a helmet and I've never been in any accidents. So I don't think it is dangerous. In your country, do you wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle?\n",
      "textContent--->Education in Japan I think that some people have the insights into education of own country. Because some people already know that it is important for country's future to raise level of education. I think Japanese education style is prior to memorize rather than style of practical education. This style is seems to be typical of Japanese education policy. Some politicians, however, changed the style and applied the new policy until pretty recently. This new policy is ゆとり教育(Yutori education). Yutori is leeway.(I'm not sure. sorry) Yutori education have some policy that it is prior to increase considering time rather than memorize time, and increase active learning time in spite of compulsory memorizing time. That is to say, new policy dislike old cramming education style. Nowadays, Yutori education was reviewed by some intellects, and this new policy abolished. Some intellects and people think that Yutori education lead to decline of a level of achievement because Yutori education decline of some lesson at school. I agree this abolition because I think a lot of knowledge generate ideas and wisdom.\n",

In ChinaTown, there are two food court. One is near Maxwell street, so it's named Maxwell food court. The other is at second floor of ChinaTown complex which is like shopping mall.

There is another nice food court. It's the ground floor of tekka center where is near Little India station. Because it's near Indian community, we can enjoy Indian curry and so on. One day I felt sick I went there to eat Nasi Briyani and drunk a cup of hot coffee instead of medicine!!! In Singapore there are many food court everywhere.

My thought: In my opinion, it is worth having a part-time job for Japanese college students. You may say that they should concentrate on studying while they are students of college. However, having it is a good experience for them before they really have a job after graduating from college. Therefore, there is no reason to think that they shouldn't have a part-time job.\n",

Seven samurais made a detailed strategy to defeat barbarous samurais,and pointed to the farmers. Seven samurais and the farmers cooperated and fighted.

      "textContent--->Japanese Collage Life There are several characteristics in Japanese collage life. It may differ from ones of other countries in that it has clear separation between arts and science, system of entrance examination, and early job hunting. First, there is usually a clear line between arts and science in Japanese  University, even in undergraduate. Arts faculty, which is called \"Bunkei(literacy system)\" in Japan, mainly concerns about human activities, such as philosophy, theology, literature, history, business, jurisprudence, politics, and so on. On the other hand, people in science faculty or \"Rikei(science system)\" in Japanese, deal with natural or scientific activities, like mathematics, informatics, industry, chemistry, physics, or medicine. Because each kind of school requires different skills or knowledge, their entrance examination also differs. Science students-to-be are required to have more of math, chemistry, and physics, while art students-to-be need deeper knowledge about Japanese, history, or politics. High school students usually have to choose art course or science course in their second or third year to prepare for different exams. Second, Japanese collage students start job hunting relatively earlier. They in general start it from the middle of their third year, and it ends at the beginning of fourth year. So, they have about one year to play along. In fact, this system is often criticized because it allots less time to students to study, which violates essential purpose of university. Of course, not all students do job hunting. Some of them want to go master course of doctor course to be a professor, or go to professional school to be a lawyer or other professionals. The proportion of those students is bigger in science faculties than in arts ones. This is partly because higher skill and knowledge is required for succeeding if you want to make use of them. These are the characteristics which I think important to know about Japanese collage life. I'd be happy if you get interested in them. So, what shall I write about next? http://lang-8.com/journal/94532 I still want you to request me!\n",

      "textContent--->Porto is the city where the witch Kiki landed?! I’ll start with what Porto is like. Porto is located 300km north from Lisbon. The river Douro runs  in the city from east to west, north and south of the city have  lots of slopes. It’s a city built in a rolling hilly terrain. It has about 300,000 population and the center of commerce  in Portugal. The whole of the city is registered as the world heritage. The scenery of the city is amazingly beautiful, and I’ve heard  that it is one of the model cities of “Kiki’s delivery service” which  was directed by Mr. Hayao Miyazaki. Actually I thought that the scenery from the south bank looked  like the one that Kiki who went to her training saw from the  sky fling on a broom. Porto is not so big city, but it has a lot of features like wineries  of Porto wine in the southern area of the River Douro. We slept like the dead due to the movement of the previous day. We woke up late slowly and had a breakfast at the hotel. Then we headed to the bus company to get the ticket to return  to Madrid on the following day. After we got a ticket, we took a walk to Jardim do Palacio  de Cristal. It was full of nature, and we could enjoy relaxing  and walking. I thought it was the best spot for dating. It had a nice scenery to heal and relax our feelings. However the park was bigger than we expected,  so we were exhausted from waking around. Although we planned to the church San Francisco before noon,  we lost our way in the city again. So we were so hungry that we went south to the River Douro  to eat something first. There were an array of restaurants along the River Douro,  and we could see lots of colorful parasols in front of them. We ordered and drank a glass of beer under the parasol from  noon with avoiding midday sun. What an easygoing and happy vacation we had!! I ate a heavy potatoes and beef flavored with mustard dish for lunch. Potato, beef, potato and beef……. It tasted good, but it’s too big for me to eat it up. If I ate like this every day, I would become like a piglet in no time…… I went with the slow flow, relaxed and had a great food and drink  and talked a lot with my friend endlessly, then it spent about  2 hours having lunch. Because time presses me all the time in Japan, the life in  Portugal was awesome pleasant like it melt me and my bones away. After our long lunch, we got off our lazy butt and started to move  to the church San Francisco we had planned to go to in the morning.\n",

Before him there was a car staying crosed on the road. Because of that car, he could stop sliding far away. It isn't good that was funny, but whenever I thought about this, it made me funny. I'm sorry for him to that.\n",

Now I'll tell about my first snowboarding experience in Alps. Actually I've worked at ski resort in Korea. So I can snowboard. I thought I am not a best snowboarder but a good rider. But Alps mountain was so different with Korea. First of all, taking cable car to go ski resort, I was so surprised and overwhelmed by high mountain and fantastic view. So I felt I was afraid of snowboarding even before starting. In fact, the mountain was so great but I could not enjoy very much. I had a hard time snowboarding and was injured. I couldn't easily forget to snowboard although I had a hard time and was injured. :) Anyway I did that!!! and next time I must enjoy snowboard!!!\n",

      "textContent--->Refusion. Once I talk with a guy even for a short time, I can tell if he is interesting person or not. If I don't find a guy charming while talking with him, he won't be charming no matter how he tries in the future. So when guys who are not interesting ask me for a date, I should find the way to refuse it politely. So usually I tell them that I'm not in the mood for a boyfriend but then guys tell me they just want to be friends with me. It is always difficult to refuse a date because I don't want to look all concited but I really don't want to go out when it is not the with a right person. I don't do anything that can causes misunderstandings to guys because I don't want to hurt anyone. I had a lot of experionces like this and I realized male and female can't be close friends.\n",

Is there any chance for me to do this before the honey moon? Haha.. Anyways I hope to talk about the situation when I take this kind of photos. To be honest, it’s embarrassing, because I feel like I’m bothering them. The other hand, I’m thinking I’ll get what I want from your couple.

Actually I badly want to say, “I’m sorry but…Shall I come up to your couple? My lens is not so good to take picture in the distance…So can I take pictures from here?” (Actually my lens is Sigma 2770mm. So there is somewhat limitation. But I don’t blame my lens because I have my health foot, which mean I can approach the object. Moreover my lens is doing its best all the time. I’m pretty sure. But the real problem of my lens is when I take a picute of lanscapes. Angle of lens is too narrow to take a picture of big building or spectacular view. So nowdays I’m using this method that after taking a serious of picutre, I combine all into one) Anyway this is how I got this pictures. Especilly, as for second picture taken in Paris(The first one is from Flrence) I badly wanted to get permission from them because the view from the front of them was much better than the back. A lot of tree without leaves stretching their arms into the sky…really nice background in comparison to the couple with warm heart. But at that time I was exhausted due to the long trip, so I didn’t have enough bravery to speak to them. But now I’m regretting that I missed the good scean.\n",

However, sudden concentration of capital precipitates rising bubble in local land price. As a result, those who are living where take a exciting event might not sustain life in their home.

      "textContent--->War of mothers This is my essay. \"Hello? Oh my god! honey~ My mom is driving me crazy! When I leave Ga-yeon (daughter of my cousin) to my mom, She always...\" My cousin starts to complain about Her mother's way of nursing. In this matter, every mom has her own belief of nursing. One of them is coming out of Alpha moms. Alpha mom is the mother who uncovers their child's talent and, by using her outstanding ability to collect information, makes her child educated well. They search the information of nursing by using internet when they get over the situation being a mother. Alpha moms consider nursing as a job and try to be child's study manager. These ways, they become a mother over-solicitous for her children´s education. This phenomenon is influenced by the social situation that sets high value on special-purpose high school and international middle school. Due to spread of alpha mom, children's education level gets higher. But expectation of the mothers makes the burden too heavy for their children. So the children lose their drive to study. And one student per day commits suicide because of a gloomy look of their grade. Because of these social maladies, Beta moms come on the scene. Beta moms look upon child's happiness through freedom as important. Beta moms want their children to choose what they want, and place emphasis on their choices. They think that developing autonomy in self-control circumstance is the most important thing because children have their learning ability in their intellectual development. Many experts side with beta moms. They stress the children's freedom. If someone restricts children's freedom, children would suffer a developmental stage. Even though they divided sharply, I think they are not so different. Both of them emphasize the love and support of parents for their children. It's just difference of way. Whether mothers choose alpha mom or beta mom, the most important thing is the figure of mom from the point of children's eyes. If they thought \"I will be the person like my mother\" when they saw their mothers, those mothers would be the best moms.\n",

      "textContent--->Three Effective Ways of Spending Time Wisely on the Bus When you are getting on a bus, somehow, you may feel that you waste your precious time because usually, you only sit on your seat doing nothing. However,  there are three effective ways of spending valuable time on the bus. The first way is listening to something with your mp3 player. For example, listening to music you like for your boring time on the bus or to something helpful like English conversation for proving your ability of English. The second way is reflecting on your day and planning. Reflecting on the day you have spent is very important. If you do it, you will spend your time very well without any mistakes. Planning is also important. If you plan your day, you will be able to handle some problems to happen wisely and you will not forget important things to do. The third way is looking out the bus. these days, many people live very busily as though they are chased by time. They are so busy that they can't afford to look around. So, during the time on the bus, just look beautiful landscape and passing people on the street. Do you spend a lot of time on the bus? Then, use these three ways and spend your time effectively for your long boring time on the bus.\n",

I came to think that such good working environments made killer applications such as G-Mail, Google Earth come to birth.

      "textContent--->Can you please help me to do presentation? Sul Nal  (New Year’s day in Korea) How many holidays do you have in Canada? Is the first day of New Year important? The first day of New Year is one of the most important holidays in Korea. Koreans call this day Sulnal. They follow the lunar New Year’s Day. Koreans celebrate the beginning of the New Year with whole family. Early in the morning, almost Koreans try to meet the whole family in their eldest male member’s house. At that time, they would wear Hanbok or best clothes. Hanbok is traditional clothes in Korea and it is famous for a bright colors. One of the Sulnal’s custom is to remember deceased members of the family. Koreans prepare a lot of food. The most important food is sliced white rice cake soup. It’s called “Dduk guk”. After eating that, younger people kneel and bow to older people. That means younger people wish older people’s the best health and longevity. Then older people wish the best wish of younger people and give some pocket money. In this day, Koeans play a lot of traditional games. Yoot is a board game of Korea. They use four bars in this game. It is a popular family game and played between two teams. A playing method is throw four bars together and checks their shape. Then they can move our chess piece. To win the game, chess pieces have to arrive the goal first. Another game is flying a kite. They believe the bad force will fly away with the kite. \t\n",
      "textContent--->Shopping Online Versus Shopping at Stores Since the advent of the Internet, more and more people have been using the Internet not only to communicate and share information between people but also to shop online. These days, shopping online has become the trend in Korea. Some people stress on a variety of advantages of shopping online while others insist that shopping at stores has more advantages. These two different types of shopping style can be compared in three points : convenience, price and security. First of all, let's talk about the convenience of each shopping style. Online shopping doesn't require spending time on going to different stores to compare prices or to purchase goods. What purchasers have to do is just to click the mouse on the computer to choose products they want at home. That's impossible for offline shoppers. However, online shoppers are unable to touch or try on the products they choose and also have to wait for a while until the goods are delivered to their home. In some cases, online shoppers are very disappointed with what they have received because the color or texture of the products are different from what they expect. Another comparison is price. Shopping online allows consumers to buy goods at more resonable and lower prices than offline shopping. For example, I usually get a 10% or sometimes 15% discount when I buy books at online bookstores. Of course, books are delivered for free if the cost is over 10,000won. However, if I buy the same books at bookstores such as Kyobo Bookstore or Youngpooing Bookstore, I can't get any discount. However, shopping online doesn't secure the exclusion of any fake or weak online stores. For instance, sometimes purchasers need to receive a refund or to exchange a product to another one when the product has some problems. In that case, the purchasers may have trouble getting a refund if they have bought the products at a counterfeit or small online stores. Unlike online shopping, products purchased at stores are refundable and exchangeable without any difficulty as long as the receipt is not expired. In the end, shopping online and shopping at sores possess their own appealing merits to attract shoppers. Online shoppers can save time from wandering around stores looking for the best foods by just clicking the mouse attached the computer at home. On the other hand, offline shoppers can enjoy shopping in a charming mood of stores, touching and trying on the items they want to get. Considering all these facts, shoppers feel enjoyable while shopping in their preferable way.\n",

Experiencing new culture and seeing the actual lives of local people are full of exciting. If my friends who is from another country visit my country, I want to give them an unforgettable memory and good impression on Korea  •\tWe have a lot of attraction in my country. Seoul, Jeju Island, many beautiful beach and we also have nice traditional culture. •\tAt first I’m going to talk about attractions in Seoul. •\tSouth Korea's most famous historical tourist attractions include the ancient capitals of Seoul. •\tMost of the international tourists come to Seoul to experience both the classical and modern aspects of Korean culture. •\t •\tLook! This is Sungnyemun or more commonly known as Namdaemun is a historic gate located in the heart of Seoul. •\tIt means literally \"Great Southern Gate.” •\tBut unfortunately it was burned by drunken person few years ago. It was very sad story. So if you visit Seoul, you may not see it. •\tEven though you can’t see it, I want to say about it. Because It stood for Seoul. As a matter of fact, It was the first natural treasure in Korea. And It is also a precious cultural heritage. So we are restoring now. Maybe you can see it after 2012. •\t •\tThese are our traditional palaces. Seoul has many palaces. Changgyeong palace was built by Koryo dynasty and Gyeongbok palace and Changdeok palace was built by Joseon dynasty. Above this we have a lot of another palaces. •\t •\t •\tThis picture is Changgyeong palace. It registered as a World Heritage. •\tAnd this picture is Biwon Garden that is beside of Changgyeong palace. This place is one of the most beautiful pond of Korea. •\tBiwon Garden is typical of palace back yards where kings and other members of the royal family would go to relax. •\t •\tThis picture is Gyeongbok palace and the biggest palace of Korea. •\t •\tThis is Korean Folk Village •\tAt here, you can wear Korean traditional dress, see the buildings and also you can try to making potteries by hand. •\tThis picture is Korean traditional wedding culture. •\tNext picture is Korean traditional instruments and dancing. When I tried to dance, It was very difficult. •\tIf you visit here, you can learn about how to make potteries by hand. •\t •\tThis picture is Han River Park which located along the riverside of the Han River  •\tHan River is the main artery in Korea. It gets through Seoul City that likes Boston. And It is also another wonderful place to relax and view •\tHan River has 29 bridges and very wonderful and I recommend that go to Han River Park at night. If I were tourist, I wouldn’t miss this view. •\t •\t •\t •\t •\tThere is Jeju Island. It is the biggest island of Korea. Also very beautiful. So Every year many couples are visit here. •\tSightseeing in jeju has been supported by the wonderful coastal climate. •\tAnd there is a purity and freshness about the air and water of Jeju. It makes the island one of the most populated regions in the world. •\tThese are dolhareubangs. It means grandfather made by rock. It stands for Jeju Island. You can find anywhere in Jeju If you don’t see the dolhareubang, There are not Jeju. •\tThis is beach of Jeju. •\tI like this place. These flower are rape blossoms If you clime the Hanra moutain that in the Jeju, you can find this place. •\t •\t •\tBusan is the second largest city of Korea. And there are operates as the main port for the international cargo in the country. •\tAnd This picture is one of the famous beach in Korea. This beach called by Haeundae. •\tI think this picture took at off-season rate. As a matter of fact, in peak season, there are almost 1 million people visit here at same day. •\tAs far as I’m concerned, Haeundae is better than Miami beach. Because we can drink on the beach legally •\tAnyway, If you went to Busan, also you should see night view.\n",

      "textContent--->this is about the movie I watched last night I watched the movie that named \"perfume\" It's about the man who has talent of sence of smell. He was born in paris that filled with disgusting smell at that time. He didn't know that he has great talent nobody hasn't until he met a beautiful girl who sold a few plums. A sweet smell from her cativated him like a magic. Meanwhile, he was aware of the perfume. Finally, all he wanted was to change a sweet smell from her to the perfume. The more he thought about that, The more anxious he got. After then he started to go his way that was meant to be. He figured out how to make a perfume from people by killing peoples. I think this movie has the meaning of love and possetion. There is fine line between love and possetion. The reason he had to kill girls implied that he loved them that much. He just wanted them by taking them. Because he didn't know how to express the love. But the movie says that love doesn't mean possetion like that you should take care a flower, instead of picking the flower if you like it, indeed.\n",

      "textContent--->volunteering I had been to 'Flower Village' to join in the volunteer work. It was difficult but i think i had a good job. Today, I'd like to talk about the importance of volunteer work for people in need. There are many people who need other's help, such as the sick, the poor, and people suffering from accidents. I think the desire to help miserable people is a part of human nature. Helping others can give helpers themselves deep satisfaction. Now most students participate in volunteer work for poor people or for their community. The experience of helping others or working for a neighborhood would give students great pride. Therefore, I think students should join in the volunteer work more actively.\n",

      "textContent--->China and Korea Traditionally, Korea people have been affected by Chinese in cultures and customs. For example, our family has a ritual called \"Jesa\" on every big holiday like the new year’s day and the moon festival. The ritual came from the Confucianism. We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like \"Sam-Kuk-Ji\", and \"Seo-U-Ki.\" Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times. Some people have thought Chinese have a bigger body than Korean because we are in different ethnic groups. Around 10 years ago, I could have the first chance to meet Chinese, first, people from Taiwan and then main land China. They spoke a language I could never understand, which made me so wonder how people from two nations were able to communicate for several thousand years and how so many cultures could be transferred between two countries. Frankly, I got impression that they were poor and little tiny but I started to enjoy their food especially ones from \"Schezan\" area.\n",

Nowadays, Trend is the full touch phone. There're a lot of that things in Korean. ( ;; Actually, I don't know how many things in here ^^; However, many full touch models in here, It is true) I considered between two models. 1. Presto (IM-U310K, SKY) 2. Cooky (LG-SU910, CYON) Those two models were cheaper models in full touch models. Actually, I wanted these two models rather than something else. e. g Prada 2, Haptic 2, Omnia, Xperia ... But soooooooooooooooooooooooo expensive ㅠㅠ 1. Presto - manly(design) 2. Cooky - girly(design) Those two models performances are similar. Therefore, I wanted to a presto model. But, It was more than costly. If I use the cooky phone, I worried about I look like a strange man. The cooky phone was targeted girls. That's why I worried about it. However, I had not enough money. haha. I got a cooky phone(white model). It's very girly but very good. I'm satisfying it.\n",

      "textContent--->Out Of Tune  I began learning the \"해금\", a Korean traditional fiddle, last May. It was a tough thing to get a lesson due to lack of time and money. But I just tried it. Back then in my childhood, like other children, I'd like to be a someone, as for me, especially in music. But it turned out that I was not a gifted child in music at all. I was so depressed to know that and gave up playing the piano in early 10s. In the moment, the drive to learn the 해금, is not to be a skillful player. I just like to play the 해금 joyfully, regarding 해금 as one of best friends. Someday it would be great if I play with likely minded people who love music. But as you know, I'm not good at playing something. So it took so much just to master basic tune: CDEFG. Fortunately,I didn't gave up it at this time. So I could play some children songs this month. It was awesome to play the 해금 though I frequently played out of tune. Sorry and thanks for my neighborhood who have endured my awful play. Dear Lang-8 friend, could I ask you which kind of music instruments is best for you? Thesedays, have you got some music lessons? It would be a great pleasure to hear your story. As always, thanks for reading my journal.\n",

      "textContent--->2011, March, Tokyo When I'm a middle school student. I loved Japanese Animations. One day, in Art class time, teacher saw to us \"laputa castle in the sky\". It was very impress. So I started web surfing and found Japanese animations. About three years later, I almost can understand easy Japanese speaking. Like a daily talk. One day, I was a part time job in convenience store. It was near tourist hotel. So everyday, I could meet Japanese tourists. They speak each other, Using Japanese. I can barely understand what they say together. But I can't speak Japanese. Some ladies, asked to me find some food that inserted \"Kimchi\" flavor. In that time, I pick the one, but ladies talk each other. \"I hate tuna. It added tuna. Tuna's chewing feeling is not good.\" It was Japanese. But I could understand. It was very fun to me. So I picked the another one and she satisfied. After years. 2011, the March. I was in Tokyo. I was trip to another country the first time. And I experienced an earthquake first time. In that time, I didn't know what is happening. Some ladies drove stroller, sudden shaking was started. That time, I just landed from boat. So I confused. I thought that time 'Oh, look at me. My leg is shaking. Stupid boat.' But everybody shook that time. I run and ladies run too. In running, I shouted one of ladies \"Earthquake!? earthquake!?\" She was nodding to me and drove stroller very fast. I met Korean guys that time. They didn't understand what's going on just like me. We told each other and smoke together. We worried about that situation. But no answer. We said goodbye each other. Then I resumed my solo trip. That day, I didn't understand what terrible disaster just started. I can't ride train cause of earthquake, and road were full of cars. Tokyo people just stayed in station almost midnight. They did not look terrified. I tried to call my home. but line was too busy. I could't make it. It was very impressed experience. I was alone, and some gigantic disaster stroke a country. I was perfectly alone that time. After three days. My trip was over. Almost half month in Tokyo. They were kind. And looks like us. pray for japan. god bless Japan. no more earthquake.\n",

I'm 21,but also I'm 23 in a Korean way of counting my age. anyway, recently I've been thinking about my life so far and where I'll be in future. and I think I haven't considered about what I really wanted to do. for a long time I've wanted to learn Spanish. but I haven't because of a lack of time and money. but these are just lame excuses. I could have learned Spanish if I had really had a fervor for learning Spanish. I have just lived my life with no passion and purpose. I'm ashamed and i want to change that. I set a goal of being able to speaking fluently in three languages; Korean(mother tongue) , English , and Spanish. even though now I can't speak a single word in Spanish and I'm not good at English,  but I believe that at least in three years I'll be able to speak Spanish and English fluently. I don't think 21 is a late age to start something new. and I'll do my best to achieve the goal.\n",
      "textContent--->Why did we start to eat dogs? From my point of view, it has something to do with our cuisine. Korean cuisine is not based on meats. Most of ingredients of Korean food is vegetables. So, Koreans need only small amount of meat for each time which makes cattle and pigs out of list. As a matter of fact, Koreans did not usually ate pork or beef unless it was a special days such as new year's day, Korean's thanks giving '추석' or someone's marriage. Besides, we needed cows for farming and pigs for their interests since they're very prolific. How about chicken? They're not that big, so don't need to worry about left over. However, killing chicken means that there'll be no more eggs! I'm not fond of 'Dog soup'(보신탕) but I think it's just part of our culture. Thus, no one can blame Koreans for eating dogs. Interestingly, lots of people in the world eat or had eaten dogs and this fact is confirmed by various sources. French, for instance, had eaten them according to 'Malher et Denis's report'.\n",

      "textContent--->it's a little bit long, but I appriciate your editting. There are many humane lives of various people and also there has his warm mind that he looked at. His humane mind that is contained in his essay gives me guidelines in my teacher life like a compass. Did I follow the spirits of the teacher? Did I respect my students as an owning personality? Isn’t it true that I am only a teacher who delivers only knowledge? I am not sure that I can answer; YES. It has almost passed about 2 years when I became a teacher. Sometimes I shifted my anger to my students when I got stressed from daily routine even if I knew that is a bad behavior. It is very difficult to control, but through his life, I could strongly refresh my mind to be a real teacher again. His action in many fields and the fact that he donates his all money from extra work give me one more lesson; be a generalist. His action is not to accumulate fortunes and fame, but for people and his way of communicating with society. I want to be a well-prepared teacher, but this is challenging. Sometimes I found myself repeating a routine and taught my students without preparations. Compared with his life in various fields, it makes me ashamed. I think large amount of background and experience are needed to teach someone. That is why it could be my priceless treasure. I have to try to become a generalist who has self-confident, because it is not easy to obtain that kind of treasure. As was stated above, Gyeong Chul Park is a Korean surgeon as well as a generalist who does one’s best. As my roll models, he arouses me to look back over my career and suggests to become a teacher respecting students’ personality and teaching well with more professional knowledge. There is an old saying; the life is a process. I resolve to try to leave my footsteps for others again.\n",

However, It didn't arrive because the station isn't an express train station. I sensed it, but I didn't tell them know. One student was asking someone of something. The other student was still stand at a loss, so I questioned on why you are going to school to her to give her relex. In order to attend club, they were going to go to school on vacation. They said sorry to us, but I said we are OK. Even though they made a mistake, I was happy when I felt their mind they wanted to help foreingers. We got on a train again, and they laughed at me. It was not negative. I sensed that they found that I look like someone. When we arrived at a rapid train station, they noticed us, and then we got off the train. While we were going to the rapid train, they asked us of taking a picture. We took pictures together, and then we got on the express train. Until we leave, They waited. I was impressed of Japanese mature civic awareness. And I knew that I look like someone in Japan.\n",

      "textContent--->Celebrity Suicide Since last year, several celebrities including actors and actresses have commited suicide in Korean and the world as well. In this morning, one of the well known actress in Korea died herself at her home. She hanged herself. She's 40 and has two kids who are seperated from their father since divorce. She has been a top star for twenty years even though she has much difficulties. It was shocking in Korea. Because there was a rumor that she related to private liabilities of dead man who is actor and is her friend's husband. He died 15 days ago. Even though his death remains with doubt. She has rejected claims at a recent press conference. But it has spreaded on web quickly and badly. She has been under the stress. After the famous person died, it affects the ordinary people by implusing to commit suicide themselves like a way of group and series. And as it happens again, the social anxiety increses. It gives me feel blue and think about a power of rumor and a press power. I hope her family will not hurt more.\n",

I had no notion of buying and I passed her. However, the chicks that were contained in small paper box, brought back the memory that I and my sister played with them of my childhood. By the time I was almost six years old, one red-hot summer day, my sister bought a chick and paid for 300 won to street vendor. The chick covered with deep- yellow feather. I could just see two dots of black. I didn't thought that the chick is  qute or pretty, also I never wanted to tough it, but it looked like small cotton candy. My sister put her life into the chick since that day, just like she will be with the chick, until it grow up and fly around the sky with puting his cockscomb on.(If the chicken can fly, it will be the bizarre scene. It would be funny, if it flap slowly its wings like wild goose.) My sister fed the chick everday. But it didn't eat the feed and finally dead, after a few days. Fortunately, it seemed her curiosity died down with the accident for a while. But I dreamed about the chick of the air for a while.\n",

I also heard that the Pope said the other day that the period of Lent is not the the period of self-development, but the period of repentance. In the ceremony of Ash Wendnesday priests say, \"Turn away from sin and be faithful to the gospel. Remember that you are dust and to dust you will return.\" The date of Easter is decided each year according to a given rule of church and the date of Ash Wendnesday and the Good Friday depend on the date of Easter. Easter This year is April 12th, so Ash Wendnesday was Feburuary 25th and Good Friday is April 10th. Many christians fast on Ash Wendnesday and Good Friday and the mony to save with fast is given to the poor people. I think that`s a good thing to do and I could fast one day on Good Friday without any difficulties. Remember 'Love makes you in peace!'\n",

Actually, the actor's playing was not so good. but this movie is not. In this movie, he is so emotional and has a sensitivity. That is one of a reason why I recommend the movie. On the other side, the story is speedy and not bored so I didn't know  the time is gone. this movie like a \"Taken\" in American movie. The story is like too. In \"Taken\", The father rescued a kidnapped daughter, But in \"The man\", the man who is the girl's neighbor rescued kidnapped a girl. The Main actors job is State secret agents too. so, I like two movies. Anyway, we have to look the point of the movie is a really like the action. Especilly, The last scene that the main actor struggle with all bad men is  very cool and exciting. If you didn't see the movie, go to a theater. I think it's not bad. But it have a lot of cruel scenes. for exmaple, the humen traffickers  take many organs from people even live men too. So I recommond that children and pregnant women don't see the movie.\n",

Four years while operating the blog, I have met a lot of people through the blog and I got closer with my friends. I also like to visit blogs as much as I operate mine. I have subscrived to many blogs through the RSS reader provided by Google. Compared to books, I think blogs are much closer to real time. It is more sincere because it's not restricted to a certain format. So I think the blogs are closer to real life than the books. When I visit famous blogs, I can see that they are ordinary people as well. They repeat making mistakes, feeling pain and learning new things. When I read sad stories, I also get sad. If Bloggers do something great, I also really get happy. When I see people worry I also think about my life. There is nothing like a person's life which can be empty, beautiful and exciting.

Improving English is the biggest reason why I chose doing an internship in the U. S. In addition, I don’t know about Trade, Commerce and Finance field and what I can do well exactly yet, but I know the U. S. is the center of international economy. I want to be able to find which job is the job I can enjoy. I want to work in an institution such as the KOTRA, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Other economic and financial companies or economic international organizations will be good for me. Internship in these kinds of institution will let me comprehend the financial or economical world. Besides I will know about international concerns in the heart of the world. Plus, this program will give me chances to meet many different people who I rarely meet in Korea. It will help me when I work globally in the future. Above all things, participating in this program will greatly help me to know and decide what I will do exactly. Actually, I’m not sure what I want to do strongly. I think experiences in this program will give me confidence about my way. English skills that I will gain in the U. S. will also put more chances into my career.\n",
      "textContent--->How can we be a nice co-worker? As you know, in companes, there are very many workers, and we can call them co-workers except you. However, there are serious workers, bad workers, nice workers, stupid workers, etc. I write and essay about the qualities that we need if we want to be a nice co-workers, thus I will mention about bad, and nice co-workers. First of all, I will tell you about the quality that I guess. I think being helpful, and kind. Here are my explanations. First, we have to be very helpful to another workers. I will tell you a kind of example. You are worker, and I am your co-worker. There are something happened in your house so you have to go to your home, however the boss said to you, \"You should finish this work or you can't go to your home. But, if you really want to go, say to your co-worker please do my work instead of me.\" So you are begging to me. However, if I don't allow, I can be a kind of bad co-worker, and if I allow, I can be a nice co-worker. But, I don't think I can't be called a bad co-worker although I didn't allow. It can be a normal, but please think about this example generally because it is an kind of example. Also, if you can't come to the company, the very nice co-worker will come to the company instead of him although today is his holiday. We don't need to behave like that. Don't forget it is just a kind of example. Next is about being kind. If we are very kind to the workers, they will like you and help you sometimes when you have to do a kind of very difficult things. For example, you are worker and I am your co-worker. And you are doing something very hard, and the nice co-worker will help you and bad co-worker will not help you. To sum up, if we want to be a good co-worker, we should be kind, and helpful. This is the end of my essay.\n",

Thought1: The NASA scientist found fossilized evidence from outer space. Thought2:  These meteorites used to hold water and organic material essential for life. A couple of hundred years ago, people could never imagine there were other places which were very far for theriselves but which are totally not that far away nowadays thanks to highly developed transportations and communications. There were always other places far from themselves at the opposite sites, they could believe it though. What they believed already appeared to be wrong because science and technology have highly developed and then we could know more things like \"the earth is round\". What if I said to them in the past \"the earth is round\"? Almost all the people might consider me as a fool or something because they couldn't believe that before. I don't think what almost all the people believe is always true. Even though science says it coudn't be possible there are some other life in the other world on the space, I wouldn't believe what it says one hundred percent because it could appear to be wrong in the future as what it have done in  the past. According to the thoughts you gave me, it seems the contemporary science also says it could be possible there is life outside of Earth so I have no reasons why I don't believe in extraterrestrial life. If it were possible, I wish I could check what the world in the future looks like because I'm very curious about it. I think the science couldn't help but must be developed because people are very eager to cure their curiosity as they want to quench their thirst. Who knows what the world in the future looks like?\n",

Its body is made of paulownia tree and its twelve strings are made of the threads from cocoons. Its origin goes back to 2,000 years but its current shape and structure were created about 1,400 years ago  by King Gashil of Kaya, a southern Kingdom in the Korean Peninsular. U-reuk of Kaya is one of famous musicians of Kayageum and introduced this string instrument to Shilla Dynasty,   a Neighbouring country in the same Korean Peninsular, but later on conquered Kaya. Kayagum was named after Kaya, which literally means 'the string from Kaya'. It was introduced to Japan around AD 9C as Shiragigodo, Meaning 'the string from Shilla'. There are two kinds of Kayageum: Pupgum is more ancient form of Kayagum with the tradition of 1,400 years and Sanjo Kayagum is a more Modern Kayageum, Which was developed about 100 years ago. Sanjo Kayageum is more widely used today because of its flexibility to accommodate modern music. by : (http://www.hanstring.com/main2.html) \n",

However, when we become adults our thoughts change to other ways. life makes us get older and older. The more we grow up, the more we know the world is so large. we taste feelings of stumbles to know how to stand up. Our parents teach us to be honestly always, however that is not always true because we know that sometimes dishonesty is better. a honest saying can kill a patient, otherwise a dishonest saying can help the patient live longer. Our parents teach us to be generous always and forgive others mistakes, so we want to forgive others mistakes, however someone never wants to do so and they cause hurt to us. after that we are getting to know how to cope with (face) such things. are our parents wrong? no, what they teach are just base and we will reach many pitfalls in our lives that they can not foresee. we must have enough intelligence to know how to give our parents' teaching to reality and intelligent people will go on intelligent ways\n",

      "textContent--->THE POWER OF SMELL One night, I was walking alone into the street and passing along book stores, cloth shops, fast food restaurants, street vendors…on Bui Thi Xuan street, suddenly I stopped and entered Minh Tri fast food restaurant with well-known chicken bread. I didn’t know why I bought one although I don’t like eating bread, but the smell of bread attracted me as the special power that I could keep on a step forward. You know? It was like somebody said to me “hurry, hurry up, buy it, so delicious!”  I suddenly remembered my lesson “smells sell” I used to learnt, and I believed that artificial smells can influence our buying behavior. This is the reason why companies have been spending a lot of money to make synthetic fragrances sell customers’ smell to sell products even they make customers remember the store later, so we, victims of smells sell, will come back for more. Each of business made their “fragrance planning” to develop company such as:  -\tUse computer-controlled machines to carry the smell out through the store’s air vents. -\tMake microwaveable foods smell good before they’re cooked. -\tGive customers coupons advertising car loans. -\tPut sweat odor on unpaid bills. -\t… And using smells to sell products were begun in 1966 when a company added lemon fragrance to its dish detergent. New uses for smells are being created every day, and that really influence customer behavior. In my opinion, store owners have abused chemicals in business to sell customers; moreover, that chemicals might affect our health because of air pollution which they have created. So, would you like to eat a candy with its natural smell or its fake scent? Are you still believe in qualified products that you want to buy?\n",

      "textContent--->My essay This is my first time on Lang-8. I'm loaded with my works. Lots of things needed to be done: my thesis, my monograph, and a coming-soon GRE test. Well, because I don't know what I should write in my first post, I'll post one of my TOEFL essay. People should pay to use public transportation Some people consider that people have to pay fee  to use public transportation in order to reduce burdens on goverment. I strongly disagree with that viewpoint, however. In my opinion, public transportation should be free to all people to reduce environmental problems, solve traffic jam in city and strengthen people's relationships  Firstly, reducing environmental problems in cities are what I put in my priority. It's no doubt that waste gases from cars are one of the most important sources of air pollution in urban areas. The amount of waste gases will increase proportionally to the amount of cars moving in the streets. Thus, if people use buses for their transportation, a large number of private cars will be significantly decreased. This will not only improve air quality in cities but also create a healthier environment for all citizens. Additionally, petroleum using for cars will also decline and we could preserve this unrenewable kind of energy. Indeed, keeping free fee policy for transporters has a  beneficial effect on environment. Secondly, solving traffic jam in cities deserves my consideration. Traffic jam has always been a serious issue in cities. It does not only seiously affect officer's working efficiency but also increase fuels consuming for cars. A plenty of cars in streets is the reason for this problem.. Therefore, when all people go to work by public vehicles, the streets will be more spacious and traffic jam will be solved easily. Nevertheless, it also prevents people from being suffered from accidents because buses are a very safe vehicle. In fact, the fewer cars in the cities, the fewer accidents occur. Finally, opportunities for people to strengthen their relationships affect my decision. I deeply believe that people will spend more time to visit their friends and relatives because they do not pay money for transportation. Moreover, in some cases people want to pay a visit to their friends but they do not have any space for parking. Thus, they will prefer to be at home rather than manage to find a place for parking. Using buses will certainly be a suitable substitution. Consequently, by visiting others more frequently, their relations will be remarkably improved. In conclusion, due to above mentioned reasons, I suggest that fees for public transportation should be free. I strongly recommend authority trying to improve public vehicles' quality and other factors in order to attract more people to use it.\n",

I have some friends who work in travel service ask me Don't go there in this vacation, because 30/4 is a holiday, so price is increase and service is decrease.

      "textContent--->TOEFL iBT vs  IELTS Although both TOEFL iBT and Academic IELTS are international tests that assess student’s English language ability, they differ in many ways. Perhaps the most significant difference is the method used in these exams. Each skill is tested separately in the IELTS. For example, the candidates only need to write essays in the Writing section or answer to several questions in the Speaking part. On the contrary, test takers must combine more than one skill when they respond to TOEFL’s integrated tasks. In these tasks, the students will listen to a conversation or read a passage before they are asked the questions. Second, the ways in which these two tests are conducted are also not alike. The iBT of the title stands for Internet-based Test, which means the candidates have to take the examination through a networked computer. On the other hand, test takers’ response needs transferring to the IELTS answer sheets given at the beginning of each part. Finally, the TOEFL iBT is considered to be about 1 hour longer than the IELTS. Because of these differences, it is advisable to consider these two tests carefully before choosing any of them. --------------- I'm having a difficulty in word choice and collocation.

Today, we have the first class of Mr. Doremon(we call our translating teacher Mr. Doremon for some special reasons but no offence) with translating subject. The class was from 3:25pm to 5:00pm. It seemed a long time but we were all so interested in. Our teacher helped us know inside out what translating subject is. It was different from what we had thougt before. He asked us what were the difficulties of this subject. We anwered after discussing together. But it was really surprising because the biggest problem of learning translaing subject was not about the languages that we wanted to translate into, but the ability on using our mother tongue itsefl was remarkable. He explained to us and we all got the point. If we are not good at our mother tongue, the first language that we really need to be fluently, then, the ability of edodmosis languages would be desreased. Now I understand the most important point of learning anything is being good at our origination first. One tree can't be strong if its trunk breaks!!!I get it now, Thank you, Mr. Doremon!!!\n",

      "textContent--->How I started learning english. This is my story on when and how I began with English. When I was still a little boy. I hated the school like most of other boys (I supposed, and now I believe :). I will write how I escaped from my preschool and how hard my mother and my first primary teacher made me become a pupil and in the next times. In fact I didn't clearly know why I must go to school but my naughty friends and our interesting break-time's games somehow made me soon realize that school not bad at all. It is a best playground that you only got if do enough learning time in classroom. A bit digressed but I just want to show you that I didn't go to school mainly for study. And it was the same with English. It's 18 year ago. That was my last year in a primary school, English was added into our learning program. I accept new subject by my old attitude that the more fun our playground and our game become, the harder we must deal in classroom. But English might be my and our most favorite just because the new teacher is very young, pretty and nice. You maybe judging me now, but sincerely just because our study time more easy, we could make more noises, do more owner things we like, do more naughty jokes, simply because we didn't fear the new teacher at all. You should know in these day, English is just begun to bring to primary, most of primary English teachers has just graduated, so they was very young. In shortly, I hadn't seriously learned English from the boy-age, the started point.\n",

      "textContent--->It has recently been announced that a new movie theater may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why?  ( I'm sutdying Toefl writing by myself, can you help me, thanks :) To some extents, it may be a good news to have a movie theater built in my neighborhood. Nevertheless, I will oppose this plan for some reasons explained below. \tFirstly, I have to emphasize that a new movie theater will be a good means of civilization. It will bring us more chances to entertain and to get access to a favorable source of knowledge, especially about other cultures, the world’s history,…. We can also see some hot blockbusters along with some immortal movies. It will encourage us, especially people who are always too lazy to drive a long way to see a two-hour movie. Moreover, with a new movie theater, other services like restaurants, coffee houses,…will find their way to develop and thus, local people can benefit from it. \tHowever, there are facts proving that the plan will bring us more disadvantages. There will definitely be heavier traffics and therefore, more traffic jams which have been our nightmare for a while, even without a movie theater. \tIn addition, the opening of a movie theater will lead to the rise of other kinds of entertainment. It can not be denied that local people will benefit from it as it has been said above, but it will undoubtedly distract our children from their studying and may even lead to some social evils, which no consciencous parent could allow. \tFurthermore, people from other neighborhoods coming to ours may increase the chance of arguments, street fighting…. With the lack of concerning from the theater’s owners which usually happens because of their priority for commercial benefit, our neighborhood will lose its secure atmosphere. \tIn conclusion, I will stick to disagree with the plan. There are many ways to help develop a neighborhood without ruining it and the government are responsible to find the best ways.\n",

      "textContent--->When will I can see they smile again?  You can tell that I'm too old for liking guys who is in the same age with your sister but right now I like them. I love DBSK, I love 5 of them. They are my very first Korean band and they are also the one who lead me in love with K-pop and also J-pop. And they will be my first and last artist I love like this. (I don't want to love any more artists). My friends say that \"Huong ah, look at yourself again you are 24 years old and next year you will turn into 25. You are too old, don't be like this. Let's your younger sisters listen this kind of music or loving these guys, not you hahaha\". They are right, aren't they? None of my friends listen to K-pop or J-pop, i'm the only one ^O^  Recently the law suit between 3 members again their management company makes me so sad. I don't want to write about them here. From a view of a 24 years old girl who have 2 years experiences in working and some of my friends are also working in media I think I understand the situation but I don't want to accept it :((. I really don't want to accept the truth. I just hope that things haven't happen. I want 5 of them remain as before, I want to see them together, I want to see them standing on the same stage together. I miss them. Another beautiful song from them \"Doushite Kimi Wo Sukininatte Shimattandarou/Why Did I Fall In Love With You\"  I love their voices, their voices is so so beautiful in this song. The video is a mix of many of their performances (you can see when watching the video) but the audio is from their performance at Tokyo Dome (the largest stage in Japan).

      "textContent--->Please help me check errors in my essay about environment. Thank you very much Along with the development of society, more and more problems are brought to our attention, one of which is environmental pollution. To reduced negative affects of pollution, discovering causes and solution of pollution is very important. From my point of view, the main problems taking place in the the Earth which human being is facing are land pollution, air pollution and water pollution. First of all, one of the primary problems is that the air surrounding everyone is polluted. Together with industrial revolution happening through the world, there are many toxic fumes discharged into environment. As a result, It brings about serious natural disasters such as: acid rain, greenhouse effect or global warming. For example, tsunami taking place in Japan in 2011 caused terrible damages as regard wealth and person’s life. Hence, I do believe that the most helpful things we can do to reduce air pollution’s effects are charging polluting factories high taxes or useing transports with less-polluting engines. Secondly, land pollution is also a serious problems that many countries are experiencing. The most important reason is the destruction of trees. This activity will generate soil erosion and floods which bring about many damages if have a big rain or storm. Therefore, in order to protect forest, governments should plant more trees in blank areas and punish severely everyone distroying forest. Finally, the last thing that must be taken into consideration is water pollution. The main reason is contaminating rivers with harmful chemical. Moreover, the melting of the ice-caps can leads to large floods which are able to sweep dirty substance away. In my opinion, the best way to solve this problems is governments have to execute policies and laws that oblige factories to treat waste water prior to pouring into rivers Once you have known all of these, you must agree with me that many countries in the world are facing negative effects of environmental pollution. Only if they execute specific solutions, the life of people will not be threatened any longer\n",

If you have insomnia, you should set up  a habit of going to sleep on time. You also try not to eat spicy food and coffee at least 3 hours before going to sleep. And do not watch TV one hour before sleeping. 3. Pursue some interests. What were your interests before? Drawing, embroidering, reading or writing? When we are busy, we often forget things that bring happy to us; however, interests are ones which decrease your stress and make you feel more relaxed. So let spend some hours each week to follow your interests, you will see the beauty of life. (to be continued...)\n",

      "textContent--->Language and culture. If you learn a  new language , I believe that you will get much more  new knowledges about many things. It’s not for fun ,It make your life more interesting. Do you agree with me? I’m a Vietnamese. And I am knew that the way of thinking of  Asian is different from the way of  thinking of Westerner. There are many different points. Because the way of  thinking of Westerner is very broad-minded and liberal but the the way of  thinking of Asian is profound and deep . Therefore when they exchanges culture each other or a Westerner live in Asia , sometime they misunderstand each other and make not good impresses. It’s a pity. For example, Korean  like the way to ask a new friends that “how old are you?”,What is your job?” Did you get married”etc. But Westerner think these questions are impolite. But they don’t know that  if  Korean ask you those , it means that they are showing interest in you. And for more example,I  have just know . Normally ,because of modest of Asian , If I were received praise from anyone that “you speak English  very well” , I will say that “no, I don’t speak well, I just speak a little” . But If I were an American ,I would say  “thank you”. Ok,It is just my story today. May be  it is  interesting. And I want to learn more .\n",

      "textContent--->Games What is game? It is quite hard to find a definite answer. Games should be a part of entertainment or perhaps, in some aspects, we can consider games are the same with entertainment. Their propose is mainly for relaxing ( the first term comes into mind about the word \"game\"). But games have more benefits than you may think. Especially, for children, they are on process of forming characters and developing bodies, games also take part in their development. \"Learning also playing\" is proper way for a good health and mind. That's why I want to assure that modern children's games are not good as they should be, at least in comparison with traditional games. I don't know much about that in other countries, but in Vietnam, there are many traditional games and most of them are physical games. As participating in the game, kids must run, chase, jump,... all are physical activities, even like sports! So they are very useful for children's healthy bodies. Active life also protect them from some diseases and strengthen their immunity system. Moreover, almost traditional games require team spirit, because they have to split into two opposite teams to compete to each other, it makes the game interesting and intriguing. They must learn how to corporate into an effective team. Even when play other games, the fact that they gather also create relationships and friendship among them, which is important in forming their personalities. Besides, there are some games help to promote their intelligence, or combine both mental and physical activities. For example, Vietnamese kids play the game that two will spread pebbles into squares arranged by certain order, as long as they can get as many pebbles as possible. This acquires calculation ability. It is clear that these games are more beneficial than computer games kids play today. Sitting one place beside the computer is very passive and harmful for their health, especially for physical health. The matter some kids are too passionate about computer games is very dangerous, when they play throughout days and nights, even without eating or drinking! To sum up, the right game is the game give you interest and the most relaxing, but the most proper and smartest chose is the beneficial one! Playing tradition games is also one way to keep our national tradition. You'll fine excitement in them, I'm sure!\n",

She is active, friendly, confident and like making others smile but really shy in love. Lane is twenty years old, the age of making date. As other girls, she always looks forward to seeing the prince of her life who is handsome, romantic, faithful and loves her. Are you wondering that she is falling in love with someone? Will you believe if I tell you that in throughout 20 years of her life, she had never loved any guys till one day, her heart was stirred by a man who attracted her at the first sight. Having a part time job at a small foreign restaurent was the begining of her love story. Most of the customers who came the restaurent were foreigners. Lane enjoyed her job so much as the very first experience in her life. One day, there was a man who came to buy some pies. I am not sure how handsome, amazing he was, but for her,he was so amazing and looked so smart. Lane was attracted by him not because of his good-looking face but his sparkle blue eyes and warm smiles made her be moveless at the moment seeing him. She thought an angel was standing in front of her and his smile was like sunshine. The sunshine could make her heart melt. Lane just wannted to look into his eyes for so long. It felt like she was enguflted in passion of a high feeling that she had never had before. Lane was so nervous that she forgot to greet him as other customers. She just said something that even she did not know what it was. Do you wonder what did the man do? Nothing, he just smiled while asking for some pies. But that smile was enough power to made her get red face and be a silly girl who was so different from herself as usual. I think no one could understand how complicated she felt at that time no ecxeption herself. She wished the time stopped turning at once but it was impossible. Lane really wanted to do something to keep him stay longer but she just watched he walk away and the only information she got was he is an English teacher who owns the most beautiful smile that she had ever seen. After that day, she always thought of him and imagined what she would do if she had a chance to see him again. She promised herself she would tell him all her feeling for him or at least, she could have his phone number. Her mind became mixed-up and her heart beat faster anytime she thought about him. She was really falling in love. She wished one day he would take her hand and they walk along the beach together happily. what a feeling!!!

People feel happy because today we celebrate 66 years we have independence as well as we have a dayoff. They go out with their families, friends and enjoy the ebunlient atmostphere of this day. And so do I. I will go somewhere and enjoy this day. So far, my country is developing a lot in comparison with it in the past. It is a good thing. However, every matter has two sides. The more we grow, the bigger the distance between us is. In the past, under no circumstances,did they break the national solidarity in the face of danger. They shared each other everything and always sticked together. They were happy because it helped us win any enermies. Now, people live more selfishly and they are not close as they were in the past. They find others hapinesses that are out of communal happinesses. They forget that the connection with the community and sharing happiness theirself helps people grow up.

      "textContent--->\t My most interesting dream Dreams are the products of our subconscious state of mind. Dreams are of many kinds. But the dream which I had last Saturday was the most interesting I have ever had. I was transported into a fairy land where beautiful fairies were dancing and singing. I dreamt that I had gone to Paris. There I went into night club and saw many exciting happenings. Twist, Ballroom and Shake dances were going on in full swing with the music blaring away. As I was watching the spectacle of dance and drama, a beautiful girl gazed upon me. I was attracted by her rosy cheeks, alluring eyes and sweet smile on her face. I at once recollected the famous poem by Keats known as \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\". Her silent expressions of love enthralled me. I was really captivated by her charm and sweetness. She was really communicating with me with her silent expressions of love and her eyes. I thought I must respond to her facial and other expressions. I walked up to her, introduced myself and talked to her. She also passed very lovely and witty remarks. We then both took our cup of coffee, while sipping our coffee we had a long talk to our heart's content. At the same time I was remembering and recollecting the eternal lines of Shakespeare: Love is not love that alters When it finds alterations; Or bends with the remover to remove, Now I was in two minds. Whether her love was true or false. But I tried to be true to her. I sincerely expressed my love to her in the most unambiguous terms. We ultimately promised to marry and live as life long companions. Soon the dance and music came to a close. With that she got up and went somewhere, saying that she would be returning soon. But she did not turn up. I was repenting for falling in love. I was thinking that I had been betrayed by this girl who had deceived me. As I was pondering over this heart-stricken subject, my eyes opened but my mind was still groggy. I thought I was in Paris but to my surprise I found myself still in Kuala Lumpur. In this dream I have come across a woman who has been well described by John Keats in his profound poem \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\" i. e. \"The Beautiful Woman Without Mercy\".\n",
      "textContent--->13 days in France To improve my english writing skill, I joined to Mylot forum. There are varieties topics for you chatting on this web. I also found out that many people have same interests as I do, such as travelling to French, writing a daily diary or surfing on the net.. I had a bit trouble when I attemped to sign up the forum. It was likely that all the forum's members are American therefore the application form required to fill the zip code of the city where I lived. Surely,I did not have any,I typed randomly 1,2,3,4,5 then I pressed the next button. To my surpise, the code was accepted. It seems that a large number of net citizens choose 12345 as their city zip codes  The first topic I made was about the song \" 13 jours en france by Francis Lai\". The song was used as background music for a documentary of The olympic game in Grenobe. It becomes more popular nowaday because it is an OST for the blockbuster Korean Drama \" Winter sonata\". This song also has a special meaning to me because it brings back memories of my old friend. We used to listen the song together, dream about going to paris at once time in our lives. My friend even learned to play it with his guitar. But his dream never came true. He passed away in a car accident five years earlier. Sometimes, I thought I would visit France to fullfill our desires. But there's something stop me. May be,I'm still scared the feeling of lossing him,who is very precious to me.\n",

      "textContent--->Nuclear technology Since the project in the 1942s of Fermi and Leo Szilard, nuclear technology has been widespreaded and used in many fields. Not long after, Nuclear power is misused as a  lethal weapon in World wars so that it produced many serious aftermath with danger to totally destroy the planet but now it has been put to positive use. Some people believe that using such a strong technology can hasten the developing process but others argue that nuclear can initiate the risk of exterminating once again. Now, we will discuss about the benifits and risks associated with nuclear technology’s use. In the first place, nuclear technology stands out in relief as a special tool in science with many prominent characters. First of all, it is the strongest energy so it can contribute to the tasks not only in life but also in many booming industries. To illustrate, there are so many types of power plants but in effective side, nuclear power plants vanquish the others with very high rate ”Nuclear power plants provided about 14 percents of the world's electricity production in 2007. In total, 16 countries relied on nuclear energy to supply at least one-quarter of their total electricity.” (according to nuclear energy institution (nei) ). Besides the use in producing electricity, nuclear medicine technology has already set up a new lucrative type of job in medicine with rising trend  and Employment of nuclear medicine technologists is expected to increase by 15 percent from 2006 to 2016 ( www. bls. gov ). Moreover, nuclear technology is a method of reducing pollution. Using nuclear means that we can reduce some toxic gases and in fact, there is a large amount of harmful gases emissions avoided by the U. S. nuclear industry such as in 1995, sulfur dioxide is 4.19 million short tons but in 2008, it is 2.65 millions short tons; nitrogen oxides is 2.03 in 1995 but 0.91 in 2008. For these reasons, nuclear technology not only develops our economy but also our health. Nevertheless, I have to grant that it has caused some seemingly serious problems. To start with, the nuclear industries discharge a little quantity of low-level radioactive waste and high-level radioactive. These things can give us some diseases and other small problems. Apart from that, with even the smallest mistakes, nuclear industries can cause many serious consequences. The nuclear explosion from nuclear factories can bequeath many after-effects. The poisonous radioactive substances leak out through the mistakes from process of handling waste. These substances soak into the soil and not only spoil the soil but also affect the animals and plants in the neighborhood. It not only has the temporary effects but also has bad influences to the future generation. Because of that, it is also sensible to say that nuclear technology can cause risks. To sum up, most of problems are two-sided affairs that they have benifits and disadvantages. However, in this case, with the development of science, avoiding the risk cannot be a difficult task and benifits of nuclear technology can be  more and more developed. Consequently, benefits can prevail the risks.\n",

      "textContent--->MISERY IS NEEDED People may find many ways to avoid misery, but sometimes you must think outside the box, accept it as an essential part of seeing the good and beautiful sides of it. First of all, misery is like the dark flavor in chocolate, it’s essential and with sweetness it completes life. For example, sometimes you have to sacrifice for your love, even if it causes you sadness and depression, because it also makes you happy because you are doing something worthy. Secondly, after suffering from misery, people will become stronger, more resolute and more independent so they can have a great energy and attitude to achieve their goals. Case in point, you thought falling apart from your love was the end of the world. On the other hand, when time passed by you knew all the tears you cried, all the sacrifices and all the dramas were worthy, because they made you have the strength you now have, to turn pain to passion and overcome every challenge in your life. In conclusion, no matter how people try to avoid misery, it is always there as a part of our life. Instead of obliterating it, we should perceive it and make it useful.\n",
      "textContent--->graphic designer  Graphic designer is a kind of artist but has many differences with primary one who just uses ordinary techniques as carving or painting, does without any advanced technology to create works. Graphic designers who have to be competent in drawing and they are also capable to use adeptly many programs or applications on the computer to feel free and figure out their ideas. Many people dream up these designers getting qualifications to be blended the clever character of engineer with the sensitive artist. Today most of graphic designers usually cling to the computer and a few machines as camera, printer and scanner. Since early of the 20th century, graphic designers commenced to become an important role for the development of commodity industry and commerce in many industrialization countries. A colossal category of jobs is covered by them, consisting of advertising, book design, branding, illustration, page layout, typography, multimedia and web media. The elements of typography, image and color are always classified and using correctly to show ideas of the designers. Especially, color is often the most important part, choosing the wrong color can be a “calamity” for their works so designers are always cautious to select the colors. They always feel like to coax people or clients by their great ideas that are based on beautiful images of design. You can realize easily many ordinary products from creators. For instance: Many foreign people always see a logo which is easy as pie with the fresh red color named “Vietnam – the hidden charm” on the plane or travel magazines and brochures when they come to visit Vietnam. This logo is a symbol for Vietnam traveling. Newspapers, magazines or logos that are made by graphic designers. Graphic Design has appeared in Vietnam for 40 years ago, but it falls behind and even it’s a far cry from some countries in Southeast Asia as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippine and Singapore. There are many reasons for this but the main reason is slow to apply new technologies day in and day out. At the present day, many art universities in Vietnam celebrate long courses or short terms about graphic design major for students but the teaching of applying technology is still few and far between so after graduation, students often do not feel up to find a good position of this occupation. If anyone wants to become a professional, they have to do over to register other training courses in abroad.\n",

      "textContent--->Scientific love I depict the show, again. This time, scientists continued another experiment. Based on scientific theories, they divined results of a speed-dating among 20 men and women. Unfairly, one woman was chosen in preliminary stage. She would received help from scientists to make her more attractive ( scientifically, of course). This way, they used making up technology to hide her drawbacks and a fashion specialist make her body like that of a model. According to theories, men are attracted by who has the similar face. Men attended the experiment also took a psychological test . Result of the test would be used to sort them into different groups. Men and women had the same result were predicted to be attractive to each other. The speed-dating conducted as usual. The result was quite surprising: scientists seemed to be not good matchmakers. Their meticulous preparation didn't give the girl more chances  to have more boyfriends. The man who scientists supposed to be the most compatible with her turned out to date with another, although he liked her at first. Scientists' conjecture about other possible couples were wrong, too. There were only 2 cases successful. So, human is more complicated, and love is still mysterious far beyond science. It belongs to mental life and makes our lives more romantic, doesn't it?\n",

I think listening constantly to understandable materials will turn out fluency. Do you know Khatzumoto, I think if you want to learn Japanese, his website will give you more information that you need. But beside, you should read other websites on how to learn languages such as How to learn any language. There's a vast number of these sites out there. Good luck with your Japanese learning. After fluent in English, I will go on Japanese with the method names LIstening-Reading (you can check out it here http://learnanylanguage.wikia.com/wiki/Listening-Reading_Method). Plus I found some people could get fluent in their target languages by watching TV (This is extremely interesting). And many many other methods, you should check as well. I think it will cause you overwhelming at first, but I hope everything will be alright, I'm now stressful as well. (Please care for my mistakes in this text, Thanks) \n",

My friend is not an exception. Today she asked me to help her buy a piggy bank because she knew I was planning to go to the market. I went out at 8:00am, and decided to buy for her a clay pig first and then i would go to buy something for me . I had never bought it before so I did not know where I should go to get it. I thought bookstores would have clay pigs. I was right, there were many beautiful clay pigs there. I chose one of the them, picked it up. Oh my God, It costed 80 thoundsand Vietnam Dong. I could not believe that a clay pig was too expensive like that. I was not sure buy it for my friend because I knew she would be shocked too, then I called her to ask. She told me that I should not buy it in bookstores because the price would be much more expensive. Then, I found piggy bank in many shops and they did not sell piggy banks. It was sunny and I felt abit tired. Finally, I came to a small shop on the last street. Luckily, I found it, a quite cute pig with a cheap price, just 10 thoundsand Vietnam Dong. The time was 10:45 am. It took nearly 2 hours to get a cheap clay pig. I came back home and did not buy anything for me. However, now I know where I should go if I wanna get a cheap piggy bank!

      "textContent--->What r u going to do next? I dunno how to be fluent in English faster then the speed of now, but I decided to continue to find the way. There's  a vast amount of methods out there, and u know, what we have to do is choose one and optimize it to fit us. But I don't find it will work, WHY? Because we will never stop finding, we will never think our current method is the best one, or at least, the one which suits us best. I have read a vast amount of articles on how to learn a language effectively, from Spanish to Japanese, from the famous one such as French to some other one such as Catalog (I don't know anything about this language, don't know who speaks them, don't know where this language is spoken). And to be honest, all of the achievement of those who mastered them is amazing. Many of them reached fluency under 1 year, some only in 8 weeks, and many other one we have to be surprised to know. Anyway, I have to admit that I haven't reached fluency in English yet,we learn it everyday, all day, all time (all English all the time, huh), but what happened, over 3 months of intense study, we don't see much improvements, why, whether it would be our method, NO, we are using the best method we know, from the best foreign language learners, then WHY, I don't know, I suppose that we're wasting the most of time, I mean we don't use if effectively. In my thought, if we have a day job or going to school everyday, we maybe even learn English faster. Maybe, I only think maybe.... We only have 12 months for reaching fluent in 2 languages, it's not a commanding goal, but only if we use the right method, and use time effectively. As I said, I will continue to research on how to learn language but it's only the second priority, I will stick to our current learning method, or at least, doing at least 2 hours a day for listening and the same time for reading. Good luck with your English learning, my buddy.\n",

It would be more proper to limit the ages of this obligation processing, we do not force them as soon as they finish their school. But in peaceful countries, there would be no need to do so.

      "textContent--->Music for life Music! Music is as old as the Earth. I suppose music appeared almost simultaneously with humankind. We take music for granted, music is familiar to us like breath. Music came to our life easily and simply. There was no need of any musician, or any singer, ancestors sang and created songs as they were sharing their emotions and their thoughts. As they were working on fields, rowing,..., they sang to energised their laboring spirit. At nights, when people sat around, songs brought community together. Therefore,as you can see today, ancient songs depict lives clearly. Nowadays, in modern civilization, music is still essential for life. Music now is not only tool to express emotions, thoughts, but also part of entertainment industry. Globalisation has deep influence on the way people enjoy music today. Instead of traditional songs, instead of listening music from CDs, radio, and live performance, modern generation heard music mainly from Internet, or what we ususally call digital music. This give some advantages: for example, music is wider spread, because listening music on the Internet is much more cheaper and easier than buying a CDs, waiting for hours a favourite song on the radio, even waiting for years to enjoy a live performance! Especially, that means people from far far countries have more chances to hear modern music. Moreover, keeping traditional songs is easier by recording them. But music industry itself protest digital music. Because, while digital music covers the world, that doesn't mean they sell more or get more. Easier way to approach music makes people hardly buy a CD, except for special occasions, such as for presents, gifts, rewards,...\n",

      "textContent--->Good job with good salary in big international company or interesting job with lower salary in a local company? Last month I and some friends at university went to a job interview at a Germany company. In fact, when we were called for the job interview, we weren't told which position they were recruiting. However, as our major is Japanese studies, it's likely translator or interpreter position. As the news came rather close (we were informed about the recruitment just 2 days before the interview) I had hardly any time to prepare and was extremely nervous coming to the interview. My Japanese is not very good and it's been quite a while since the last time I spoke English. I thought I hadn't done well with either my interview or my ability test. But 2 weeks later, they called me and said that they want to take me for the internship during which they will observe and see whether I am qualified for the position in their company. The internship will start from July, after my graduation from university. However, to be honest, despite the fact that this company is a famous one and they may offer me good salary and good working environment in the future, it's not in the field which I have interest in. I love culture and traveling, and I always want to work as a tourism manager in a good tourism agency. However, it might be a more difficult way for me to get close to my closest target: becoming rich and helping my parents out, buying our very first house and giving them the chance to travel abroad to dream lands. It's difficult decision but I think I have to do well in my internship so that I can get the job first. After that, I will consider my interest and future.\n",

During 40 years, the camera always adheres with his eyes through many wars. James attained 5 prizes from the World Press Competition and he is going to attain more and more greater achievements. In 2006, he was injured in Afghanistan. After 3 surgeries, he had to spent 2 years to recover his health. In 2008, he came back with the photography project named “Inferno”. This project consists of many pictures, these images depict about victims of war and it was acclaimed by colleagues all  over the world at that time. All of the images in this project were published in many famous newspapers, magazines. In 2009, an American publisher received to produce the book named “War Photography”. Everyone is astonished by his works, many people have never seen any similar scenes before. His aggregate pictures are authentic evidences to admonish everybody of the consequences from war. Many people were killed, many children were abandoned, many cities become empty places. Especially, the conflict or civil war is aggravating the situation in some poor countries. The ailment, violence, starvation is augmenting day by day. The damage of war on economy is appraised up to billions of dollar. Nowadays, more and more people have the aversion attitude about war and of course we need more war photographers like James Natchwey. In an interview, he said that: “Above all, this job is not a breeze, it is a real arduous job, if you want to become a war photographer, you have to adapt quickly with the dangerous circumstances filled by acrid smoke, messy voices, guns and abrupt injuries, add up to anticipate any trouble in a strange country because sometimes you can not bank on supports to solve your problems and you must be always at ease. As a matter of fact, war photographers often are apt to be single because they never want anybody to get anxious thoughts for their life and they also have an austere way of life…” And he was asked “What’s the most terrible thing in your job?” James answered that: “My camera is broken down all at once”\n",

First of all, I will analyze reasons which make me getting involve in the trouble. Then, I will discuss with our team members to solve the existing problem. I know that worrying and sadly will ruin my thinking, thought I try to avoid these one. Secondly, If I can not solve the problem by myself, I will ask my supervisor to support me. My supervisor's advice is the best solutions for me, they are true in all times. Thirdly, I will think in positive way , because i know that everything always have root causes. I can handle the problem by exploring and solving all these roots causes. In my opinion, I think we should share our problems to everyone who you trust and do not give up is the best solution for all bad cases.\n",

When I came to my hometown--Yangzhou city yesterday, I was convinced that it is very true because the city has changed a lot over last several years. Yangzhou locates in the southeast China and is beside the Yangzi River. Althouth it is a small and time-honoured city, Yangzhou is becoming more and more flourishing and vigorous. An industrail park has been built just beside the old town and many high tech companies are booming in the park. With income incresing rapidly, local citizens who were used to riding bicycles have changed to driving cars. Restaurants, shopping malls and a variety of stores are springing up all over the city. When people realize that they can develop careers in small cities, large cities like Beijing and Shanghai may relieve some burdern.\n",

In Chinese, cousin can be 表姐、表妹、表哥、表弟、堂姐、堂妹、堂哥、堂弟. But in English all of them are one single word \"cousin\".\n",
      "textContent--->Test for National Civil Servants In recent years, there are more and more people who have participated in the test for national civil servants. Millions of students choose civil servant as their most ideal occupation after graduation. And among them, the high-educated, like masters and doctors, take quite a large percentage. The craze in civil servant test has attracted widespread attention. The following reasons can account for this kind of craze. Above all, nowadays college students face great employment pressure. Civil servant, as one of the most stable professions in today’s China, becomes their preferable choice. Moreover, in recent years, the welfare and salary of civil servants have been improved greatly, which undoubtedly attracts many people. Besides, the high social position of civil servants is an important factor drawing many people to take part in the civil servant test. In my opinion, this craze in civil servant test will continue in the following years. However, from the long run, it doesn’t do good to the development of the nation. If most high quality talents gather in the government departments, it might lead to a waste of resources. Therefore, both the individuals and the government should have a more objective recognition of the civil servant test craze\n",

Just like runing on a bank, the stock of salt would been exhausted quickly if large numbers of people suddently pour into stores to purchase as much as they can. The good news is that the crisis is coming to an end because the government has promised to provide engough salt to meet market demand. It is funy that many customers begin to go back to refund money. The apparent cause of the event is that the nuclear crisis in Japan has really scared people and they don't know how to deal with it. However, when I heard that the stock price of some listed companies whose businesses are related to salt or iodine went up rapidly in last two days but slumped today, I began to understand why such weird things took place here. It is very likely that somebody has spred out the rumor and used people's panic to make money. I think it would be a big shame for the stock maket's supervisor if my guess is true.\n",

      "textContent--->In the oncologic surgery ward of an inpatient department (2) Today 'The Broadcast Station' man[*] felt nausea. Nausea is a common side effect appearing during the chemotherapy. The drugs make the patients feel sick and lose appetites, when their need most are foods. It's reported that many cancer patients don't die of the disease itself, but of the innutrition caused by the therapies. ’The Tigress‘[**] seemed very worried about her husband's condition. The congee and the roast fish she brought became a mission impossible to him. He tasted only a little bit then refused to eat more. But don't forget that a tigress is a tigress. No means nothing to her. It's just a piece of cake for her to 'persuaded' her husband to put the rest food in his mouth. However, it's not an easy task to stop him vomiting after 30 minutes,even for 'The Tigress'. When the terrible vomiting finally stopped, the man started to murmur things like his wife shouldn't force him to eat that much. The Tigress refuted his argument and provided an alternative explanation. She argued with confidence that this was all because he ate too fast. Then she recalled that she had faced much worse situation but still manage to eat enough food. 'Chemotherapy is nothing.' she said,'You should feel lucky you are not pregnant. When I carried your daughter, I felt so much worse. I vomited as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning. But then I still ate. Then I vomited again. Then I ate again. Then I vomited again... ' At the end, the man admitted that he was just not tough enough and he should definitely learn from his beloved wife. After that, he was allowed to sleep. Of course, he ate some more congee before that. The Tigress won the battle as always. Booyah!

He asked us ,\"Is there a KFC here?\" I answered \"Yes\" with a lot of surprise, because he spoke in a slowly and not clear voice with hands danced, and said a same word many times in a special pronunciation. He asked again,\"Yes? Where?\" I was amazed , still answered but with a slow voice as him ,\"Go stright and ...\" He seemed not understand me, and this time my friend asked,\"Are you a Japenese or Korean?\" I began to look at my friend. The talking between I and the man were all in Chinese, but he said in English. The man said he was Korean. Neither of us could speak Korean and seemed the man spoke Chinese better than English. He asked how far but I did't know how to explain it finally I told him to go down this street and he would saw the red posts and ads. That was it. On the continued way home my friend told to me that he thought the man spoke Chinese very well in all Koreans that he knowed.

      "textContent--->Working or Travelling Before University It's not uncommon for some students to get some work experience or travel for a year before going further studies in university. In this essay I would like to explore both negative and positive effects of this phenomenon. The benefits obtained from working and travelling before university are obvious. Nowadays, the tuition of tertiary education can really cost a fortune, which force some students to work for a period in order to relieve their parents' economic burden. Also, since the ultimate purpose of education is employment, it's necessary for students to get a rudimentary grasp of what skills are required in work, this can only be achieved by previous working experience. Regarding travel, it's definitely a great opportunity of releasing study loads, providing moments of peace, expanding visions. Nevertheless, many argue that postponing studies would take away precious periods for studying. After a year without studies, many youngsters would find themselves somewhat a bit difficult to catch up with complicated university lessons. Moreover, despite being employed, students in high school degree have insufficient competence perform well in work, which turn out to make them lose assertiveness. Besides, a large amount of money is required when it comes to travel, the cost of travelling is beyond many students' reach. More importantly, young people often lake a strong awareness of self-protection, thus it's hard to ensure their security during working or travelling processes. What I mentioned above are but few pros and cons of working or travelling before university, students need to outline specific plans according to their own conditions.\n",

      "textContent--->About Lang-8 I heard the earning of this service per a month is mere about 100,000 yen (10,000 US dollars). Lang-8 is one of the most useful services on the web for world people. However, it is very difficult for this service to succeed in business. So I want to be a premium member for supporting this service, but here is a problem. I don't want to use my credit cards on the web for security. So I want to use \"web money\" which we can charge money in convenience stores. However we can use as instrument of payment for this service only credit cards and Yahoo wallet (a payment service of Yahoo! Japan). Yahoo wallet can be charged money only by credit cards. There are many people who can't have credit cards in the world, of course in Japan too. For example, teen agers can't have credit cards because they are not adults. In Japan, such many freelance workers as writers, cartoonists, and actors can't often pass the screening by credit cards companies because their incomes are irregular. Using only credit cards and Yahoo wallet as a payment tool is omitting such people from this service from this service's premium members, in fact. I am very thanking to the creators of this site. However, I hope that they take more universal tools for payment.\n",

      "textContent--->Money Tuesday June 21, 2009 Sunny I’m engaged in IELTS writing today. So I’ll write a topic about it everyday if possible. I hope and I guess I’m not along. So I will post my article on Lang-8 if I write one. If there’s anyone who can revise my article, I’ll really appreciate it. Today’s topic is， Many people think that the government should spend the large amount of money in channeling into artistic and cultural projects on basic infrastructure projects instead. Do you agree or disagree? And here is my answer. Indeed, there are many basic infrastructures are needed to be build now, and the past and the future. They are always needed. But shall we spend the money for artistic and cultural projects in them? For me, I prefer not spend these money which is ordinary suppose to be used for cultural construction. Basic infrastructures are important, but it’s not everything in our life. The capacity of a cask is determined by its shortest wooden board. Basic infrastructure should not be the shortest board of our society, so does art and culture. Of course, basic infrastructures are important, and they are badly lack in many parts of China. But I think we should not, and in reality, we didn’t pay all the money for basic infrastructures. Why? In my own case, for instance, I can stand for living in a place which is not so good on material conditions, but it would be intolerable for me to live in a place without some book to read. Are you willing to live in a world with no books to read, no music to listen and no paintings to admire, though there’s every material you want? I can’t imagine how this kind world would be like and this is the world would like if we spend all the money in basic infrastructures and no money in art and culture. In the one hand, art and culture is needed for a high quality life, in the other hand, basic infrastructures are needed in many place. If we want to improve our life quality, obviously, we need to make a balance between material and spirit. Basic infrastructures are truly important, yet in the same time, with the improvement of material, we also need an improvement in art and culture. As the saying goes, we eat for life, not live for eat, similarly, what’s our purpose to spend money in basic infrastructures and art and culture? For me, I get the feeling that we spend this money to make us feel our life is happy and meaningful. For this purpose, shall we spend all the money in basic infrastructures? Precisely, a person without “spirit food” would not be happy, and who will think his or her life is meaningful without great spirit? All in all, we need to make a balance between art and culture and basic infrastructure. I would prefer to make more money to spend on basic infrastructure, not simply cut down the money on art and culture and spend them on basic infrastructure. All right, I finally finished. I hope you can give me some suggestion in revising or rewriting this article. Thank you for you reading and if you do give me some suggestion, I’ll really appreciate it. Thank you once again.

      "textContent--->Take Pros and Cons Of College Student's Taking Part_time Jobs Nowadays many college students take part_jobs in their spare time. It is no doubt that taking a part_time job can bring about several benefits to college students. Above all,part_time jobs provide students a valuable chance to put their knowledge into pratice,which can improve their greatly. Furthermore,through taking part_time jobs can make they contact with many kinds of people in the campus or society,which is significant for them to get more experience about how to communicate greatly with others and is also benefit for the later work and study. In addtion,students can get some money to release the pressure on their families(to help lighten the burden on their families.) However,as every coin has two sides,taking part_time jobs have also some disadvantages. For one thing,some students spent so much time on the part_time jobs that neglect their study. What's worse,students may be cheated or hurt by their employers for lack of enough experience. weighing the pros and cons,I think college students can take some part_time jobs whether in the campus or in society. Undoubtedly,we can know the society more from the part_time jobs. But it is worth nothing that we cannot spent much time on it but influence our study. To conlude,if the spare time is enough,it is better for us to step out of campus and take some part_time jobs.\n",

      "textContent--->Tough Period Everytime it hits the end of a semester of Architecture, things get tough. For now, I haven't slept for two days and three nights, struggling with my project, which is due in a couple of days. Sometimes I was just wondering whether I'd got a good timing. I've heard that people can make it through their tough work even with 8 hours long sleeping time and extra time for playing games and stuff. I do have realized that architecture is quite different from the others. It requires some sort of ALL-ROUNDEDNESS, which has been mentioned by our lecturer a few times. Therefore, it requires the students to sort out a better schedule on things. Besides, according to our lecturer, architecture is one of the courses that require students to read as mcuh as possible. Broadening our horizons enriches our minds, thus enriches our design. However, my biggest problem has always been about improving my English. Without a good knowledge of English, without a rich English vocabulary, how am I to read more books? In an essay test a few days ago, I scored 12.5 marks out of 20, which was truly irritating. My lecturere told me that my essay was like translated straight from Chinese, which was not concise enough. Besides, my essay contained too much informal grammar. Yes, that's what I've been feeling for myself too. But as a matter of fact, that derived from my pevious way of learning English when I was still in China. Anyway, I'm learning a language in a rational way. In other words, when I hear the word \"bus\", the first thing pop out in my mind should be an image of a real bus, instead of either the pronunciation or the three letters \"b\" \"u\" \"s\" or the Chinese meaning \"车\". That's my own way of ensuring that a certain word has sticked to my mind. But so far, this hasn't exactly happened to me. Well, a bit off the track. Life alone in a foreign country is truly hard. Luckily, I've got dream, and that's what keeps me on for long. I hope that I can lay my own landmarks on earth some day in future. Cheers! To myself! And to all of our kind who are fighting hard for their future.\n",

This software can automatically watch what you are doing while you use your computer. After a day's work, you can view what you have done and how long you spent on each item. For example, I can find out how long I've used chrome, how long I've coded, etc, even how long I've took to write this entry. This information is really useful for us, because we can figure out where time is wasted and avoid it in the future. The only shortcoming of this software I've found out is that this software will store users' information online. So I'm a little worried about the safety of my private information.

If I were to \"stuck\" somewhere here,I am not going to \"banish\" or \"bear down\" my self,yet.\"Silence\",I have to keep myself \"silent\". Someone in Taiwan got assaulted while that person was trying to smuggling some \"humongous\" \"bears\" into the country,but the police officers in Taiwan mostly are\"corrupted\",with no more \"interceptions\" from the police officers,the guy was freed,though. But I still consider that a \"theft\". I guess I can't really blame the officers at the lower position,that must be something that made the higher lose their \"dignity\",and so the \"employer\" \"reckless\" decision,resulted in the \"employee\" did that \"outrageous\" act. I almost \"passed up\" when I found out about the truth,but I think somebody's \"mentality\" is just not easy to be \"subdued\". Is it possible to totally \"exterminate\" crimes with this kind of police force?I think that is \"gonna\" be hard,don't \"bother\".\"Stop \"yapping\"!\"This is what you will get from them when you try to get help,no body is going to come out and \"mediate\" the problem.

      "textContent--->Should we put shops, schools, offices and homes in certain areas? In many cities, planners tend to put shops, schools, offices and homes in certain areas. To what extent do you think the advantages of this practice outweigh the disadvantages? As the explosion of the population, how to design the layout of a city has become to a serious topic. Some planers claim that shops, schools, offices and homes should been placed in particular areas to make city orderly. While another sound insists that these houses should be built randomly at the initial. In my point of view, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages in this practice. We have to admit that orderly layout can make a city looks more confortable, and sometimes, it would bring more convenience to one's daily life. For example, when people get some emergencies, they would definitely know where to go and how to get there in a very short time. And more than that, if we put all the stores together, customers do not have to drive around to choose the products they need to buy, which would save a lot of time. However, the disadvantages of this practice, which cannot be ignored, are still exist. Specifically, assume we build all the homes together in a certain area, it is predictable that traffic jam would happen every working day, people drive home in a same crowed way. Moreover, it must contain more than one hospital or school in one city. It is unfair to build schools or hospitals in a certain part area of city to those people who lived far from these public places, which is the same for stores and offices. Overall, I do not support the viewpoint of putting variety of houses in certain areas, the benefits will not achieve the planner's initially expect. The disadvantages are far more than the advantages brought from this practice.\n",

      "textContent--->Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: teachers should be paid according to how well their students perform.  In this knowledge-booming era, more people accept education now than those did before, that is to say, teachers play important roles in developing students’ knowledge and behaviors. How to judge teachers’ salary is proper or not? I totally can not consent the statement that teachers’ salary depends on how well their students perform. Here is why. First of all, it is unjust for teachers to judge teachers’ salary is according to their students’ performance. Many critical factors beyond classrooms, such as students’ family and friends, have great impact on students’ behaviors and learning efficiency. It is necessary to take into account other influence that may affect students’ performance. Accordingly, teachers should not completely account for performance of students. Second, teachers were paid according to how well their students perform, prompting a counterproductive influence on students. In order to earn better salary, teachers would enforce students to study extremely hard and push them to perform well under strictly regulation and punishment. As a result, students feel too stressful and frustrated to go to school with happiness, causing negative impact on students’ behavior reversely. Finally, how to measure students’ performance is a quiet difficult problem. Are students who get great grades good students? Or do those who are polite and of integrity perform well? There is no standard answer because teachers have their own criteria to judging how well their students perform. Therefore, it is not easy to develop a just and persuasive salary system to decide teachers’ earning. To conclusion, although someone claims that teachers would teach their students better if their salary were consistent with their students’ performance, the drawbacks of this means clearly outweigh its upsides. In my opinion, judging teachers’ salary should consider all aspects of their performance, such as teaching attitude, rather than merely depend on their students’ perform.\n",

And I still have another task, word of the day, which spend me about twenty minutes to paste the word sheets here and there in company.

On the other hand, they lied, doubted, killed, destoried, and set off the nuclear bomb. But all of these are reasonable, I think. Maybe they were healing their souls, cause they showed their love to each other, and themselves. In the last episode of season five, the 'fake' John Locke had Ben kill Jacob in 1977, and Juilet set off the bomb thrity years later.

Movie scene appeared that California sinking into the sea, Kennedy crashed into the White House, aircraft carriers, Yellowstone volcano eruption, awash and several other major Himalayan art scene, is indeed imagination and visual effects technology perfect union's classic lens. But what can move truly audience is the human’s tenacity. So many people say that China element become mainstream Hollywood commercials in recent years, and is the most performance of a positive in the film 2012. The ark is made in China, it shows that China is a big manufacturing factory. I don’t know it were a good thing or a bad thing. In my opinion, it seem laugh at China anyway. When the protagonist family and his boss came to China just meet  with Chinese air force.

      "textContent--->The small things that make me happy I think sometimes small things can make me feel happy, but sometimes not. People say jokes can make me happy, some people use strange voice to sing songs can make me happy, people make funny face to me can make me happy and so on. There is a small thing happened in my life that made me happy. My brother always sleepwalked when he was 8 years old. When he did that, he often said “mom, mom, don’t leave me along.” At that time, my mother was around him. His dependence is very deep. So when my mother and I saw that, we laughed at him. This kind of things happened several times. I always think of that and laugh.\n",

      "textContent--->I need a very urgent help~ could you help me correct my very short essay? It means a lot to me~~~Please~~ It is difficult for governments in developing countries to decide which should promote first when confronting advanced skills & technologies and education. Personally, I fully sanction that governments in those developing countries should give priority to education. With incredible fast development of this world, there are extensive needs for highly skilled and trained people. We should clearly understand that the competitions for advanced technologies are, in face, competitions for outstanding professionals. Therefore, it would seem that education should be paid more attention, because it can foster many competent people thereby contributing to high speed development of societies. Believe it or not, there exists many evidences to prove that promoting education first is correct. Take Japan for instance, after warⅡ, the economy of Japan was destroyed devastatingly. People were poor and depressed. Surprisingly, the government at that time, invested a majority of money in schooling, simply in order to promote the education. As a result, Japanese economy ranked top ten in only a decade. Interestingly, it was a very important shift for Japan impressing the world as a country with numerous high technologies. That is to say, improvements of industrial skills and modern technology are based on widespread education. Some people may worry that promotion of education cannot impose direct benefits on societies in comparison to improvement of techniques. In my opinion, it is true that impact on developments of societies are delicate in a very short time. However, when it comes to a long term, education is the most effective and efficient way for a country’s prosperity. To sum up, it would be a wise choice for a developing country to promote education first, because it can not merely offer a multitude of excellent professionals, but giving a rise to improvements of modern technology and industrial skills at the same time.\n",

From those overwhelming advertisements, it is a company which has over 800 professional marriage agents(actually 800 salesperson) are working for you. I did receive some phone calls from the company. The first sales asked me some questions and dived for VIP service shortly. I told her I would like to think about it. I've tried those sort of sites before. I found some friends by sending interest sign or website messages. So I thought this site is the same, I should be able to find someone without costing a lot. Actually I was wrong. Last week I searched few people on that site and sent interest requests. One of them accepted my request. Then I clicked the button'I want to contact him', the coming message was'Do you want our sales contact this person for you?' .... Suddently I understood something and gave up. After 5 mins a phone call came, 'Hi we saw you sent... and this person accept your interest, do you want to upgrade to VIP now?' 'If I want to contact with him I should pay, right?'  'Yes, that's the thing.' 'No, I don't like your business way..' I told him. How do you think, my friend? If you were me, will you upgrade to VIP?\n",

      "textContent--->Personal Statement Personal statement My name is Yangbin, a student from China, Dalian University of Foreign Languages, majoring in computer science (Japanese and English bilingual education). I would like to scale higher intellectual heights by taking advanced studies in your Master's program. Such studies will help me make great progress on knowledge of literature in my field. It was Grade Two of my High School when I first contacted with Internet technology, I was curious, and eager to discover how it all worked. As my understanding of computer technology accumulated, I was draw further and further into this amazing new world. Human beings had made tremendous progress, building new roads along the great highway of civilization. Wonders such as distance learning,   virtual reality and robot on intelligence. So I made up my mind to choose computer science as my major. At the same time, I was also keen on learning foreign language , then I attended Dalian University of Foreign Languages. In my undergraduate studies, I benefited from the Software Academy of Dalian University of Foreign Languages that had given me a comprehensive exposure to the core areas of Computer Science and a strong conceptual understanding of that. In these three and half years of study, I had strived to maintain an approach of expending independent effort in all my endeavors. Learning independently and sharing my knowledge with others has been most worthwhile, when it came to comprehending a concept. At the same time, I also learnt Japanese which was my first foreign language, and got the certification of JEPT2. Over the past two years, I had developed an interest in the areas of Compiler Construction and Information Retrieval. The Compiler Construction lab sessions last semester required the design of a compiler for java programs that were restricted to loops, Switch case statements and simple input and output. The work involved in this, as well as the courses, Formal Systems and Automata and Compiler Construction had led me to appreciate the intricacies in this field. When I became a junior student, I attended the practical training courses offered by NIIT. During the course, I could use the C# and ASP. NET very well. However, for my MS degree, I remained open to other topics as well. Through the years I spent on learning IT, I found that it was an industry which could change the world, at the same time, make human life more colorful and convenient. So I decided to continue to pursue a master degree in IT field. When I was a high school student I first heard of your university and how it motivates bright young researchers to realize their ambitions. After a careful study of your university, I felt my study could be further developed in your university with advanced research facilities, first-class faculty, and excellent academic atmosphere. Convinced that my academic background had prepared me for becoming a suitable student at your university, I am also certain that with your guidance I will spare no effort to contribute to life science. In conclusion, I would like to add that the essence of university education lies in the synergetic relationship between the student and his department. I feel that graduate study at your university will be the most sensible extension of my academic pursuits and a major step towards my objectives. I would be grateful to you if I could grab this opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at your institution.\n",

      "textContent--->tell me about your biggest failure. This is my answer to the question. There might be somewhere I can't say it well. Please help me make it more natural and conversational. THANKS! Well, so far I have never experienced something I believe was a big failure, but I do have something that I really don’t satisfied with. It was when I first took over the minister of the propaganda department. And I was totally new to this position. I had no idea what to do and how to do it. You know as a minister, I not only took over all the jobs and also the contacts of the ex. Shortly after my succession, I got my first mission. Our team must designed a poster for a event to a deadline. I can’t recall what it is about but I do remember the guy I came to for printing the poster. At first, I contacted him by phone, he said yes ok, you can just send me the file by e-mail, and I will give the poster some time, someplace. He sounded a little uncertain, but I chose to believe him. When the day he promised came, I didn’t see my poster. So I called him again to check. He said sorry, it was almost done, give me more time. How stupid I am. I believed him AGAIN. And probably you see the next , I got fooled again. At last I had to tell my boss about it. Fortunately, the mission was not so important. I still had time to fix it. So I decided to meet this man in person, and got the poster done as soon as possible. This man is a person that takes credit as nothing, and my mistake is believing him. I don’t understand how the ex-minister put up with him, but I never come to him for printing again. Here is what I learn from. (I find I can’t describe what I learned. I want to express the meaning that you cannot fully believe some guy you don’t know well, and always leave some space or some way to fix it. Can anybody say it in a good way?)   Failures should be treated as obstacles to overcome not as a reminder to keep you feeling bad about yourself. I mean, it happens, if you were put down by failure doesn’t mean you were a failure. You learned from your mistakes, but it was past history, today, you should focus on looking forward, not backward.\n",

Any suggestions of corrections in relation to the topic will be accepted humbly by the author. (including task response,coherence and cohesion,lexical recources,grammatical range and accuracy) Topic:Foreign tourist abroad should be charged more than local people when visiting the local historical and cultural tourist attractions. To what extent do you agree or disagree？ Never in human history have we witnessed such an overwhelming problem of whether it is reasonable to charge more for the foreigners than indigenous dwellers when visiting the historical sites. From my perspective, such behavior is by no means unjustified. It is acknowledged that the government, which aims at illuminating the culture, should give priority to local people, making them keep the history in mind. On such occasion, only through price mechanism can they ensure the superiority of local citizens when treating with domestic travelers and exotic visitors. Under that circumstance, the indigenous individuals may feel a sense of national pride, which enables them to work and study more diligent for the prosperity of their own countries. In addition, charging more for the people from other countries is not only able to boost the local economy but also providing an approach to relieve the financial burdens of the government, which is conducive to the development of society. Apart from this, if folks from any places were asked the same price, then, an upset sensation among indigenous people will emerge, losing cultural identity and social belonging. The opponents, however, argue that the culture relics belong to the human beings that each individual ought to be considered equally, claiming that this is especially true in terms of the preservation of culture heritage. What I need to emphasize is that they didn’t take other decisive factors into account. Compared with domestic dwellers, foreigners are more likely to spoil the historical sites, illustrating the fact that the possibility to guarantee intact sites is small, detrimental to the places of interest. In a nutshell, I am convinced that asking for the higher price for the exotic travelers is not unwarranted. For the sake of making the general public have a pride sensation as well as booming the economy, it is advisable to do so.\n",

      "textContent--->A New Journey Here is a composition and I would appreciate it if anyone could help me correct it.(*^__^*)    It’s a sunny day when I first came to the coastal city where I was to begin my college life. A thirteen-hour train journey had made me totally worn out, but I knew another new journey was waiting for me. After arriving at the campus, I followed the suggestion my families had given to me—work hard and care about my own business. As a result, I looked a bit like a loner, doing all kinds of assignments at most of time, while chatting with roommates a little. Even so, they had been very friendly to me and never stood by when I was in trouble. Two months later we heard the news that a contest called One week of my dormitory was going to be held. It aimed at showing dormitory culture and required every group to present it to juries and audience on the day of contest. I was preparing for the mid-term exams then and had no interest in that contest. But the other three girls in our room were very excited at the news and began to discuss it eagerly. Finally they came up with a plan according to the contest rules, in which each of us should draw a picture and decorate our room with different styles. Since they all showed great enthusiasm, I thought I’d better not to disappoint them. So I spent half a day on designing and drawing my picture. Before going to bed, I put it up, thinking that I had finished my part in the group work. As with the others, they had also contributed a lot to the decoration. Besides, two of them made a movie about our daily life and the culture of our dormitory. When it came to the question who should present it, they considered me the best choice, for I had a proper voice for the presentation. I didn’t want to waste more time on the useless thing, so I refused without more consideration. Apparently they were a little dissatisfied with me, but they didn’t force me to accept their advice. Eventually another girl took my place on the day of contest. Although the presentation was not perfect, but due to our attractive decoration and impressive movie, we got the highest score and won the first prize. In the following awarding ceremony, everyone was very happy, including me. But in the thunderous applause of congratulations, my inner voice was extraordinary sharp. “You are too cold and selfish to deserve it.”  I suddenly realized I actually was. How could I do that? They regarded me as a friend while I took everything for granted. If it was me who did the presentation, maybe we have done it better. I felt ashamed when my roommates smile sincerely at me. I found that suggestion wasn’t always right. I was not alone. In many cases, it was far from enough only to care about my own business. Especially in a group, corporation was necessary and everyone was supported to do his best. Since then, I have changed a lot. I began to try something I used to think useless and found my college life more enjoyable. In college, study is important, but not crucial. And it shouldn’t occupy all of my time. There is a fact no one can deny that something else is much more valuable than study on this journey, such as friendship.\n",

Nowadays people are devoting themselves to learning for pursing [pə:sing] a better life. Recently, more and more parks, zoos, and museums are being built; what’s more many museums are all free. \tA large number of people can’t help wondering ['wʌndəriŋ] if the museums are  meaningful. In fact, as we are enjoying a better life, people’s thought are changing. Food is not the only thing we longing for any more. Many people want to improve their spiritual standard ['stændəd]. So, the museum is a good place for people to broaden their minds. If we can visit a museum for free, more and more people could have the chance to learn. Even though free admission to museum have a lot of benefits; however, there are still some problems. Some people are lacking of the sense of protection. As is known, the exhibits in museum are precious but fragile. The more people visit museum the easier the things can be broken. The management of the museum can be a very tough mission for those employees in museum. As the saying goes “every coin has two sides ”. we can’t easily say it is good or not for museum to open to public for free. But I think the knowledge in museum is invaluable. If we can achieve them in a free way that can be fabulous.\n",
      "textContent--->A Restaurant I Like A Restaurant I Like The restaurant, happiness 131, is one of my favorite. I like it not only because of its food but also its name and the happiness it brought to me. The restaurant locates No. 131 Xinfu Rd. Xinfu in Chinese means happiness which make it selected as a scene for a famous idol drama which name is “Corner with Love”. No wonder more and more people come to the restaurant. I remember it is the place in where I dated with my girl friend, who now is my wife, for the first time. Although it has been two years yet I can still remember the day clearly. The restaurant looks primitive but tidy. It is not conspicuous at the side of the road if there is not two big Chinese characters “幸福” on the top of the wall. In daytime, it is really peaceful. However, you can see many people are eating in full swing through the big window in its wall when you pass by it in the evening and there is always a long line outside during the evening. Going into the restaurant, on the right side, there is a wishing wall on where many boys and their girl friends write down their wishes in a paper and stick it. They believe their wishes made in this way will come true someday. And they are pretty useful for the restaurant in busy time; people do not feel boring while waiting for seats. On the left side and second floors, wooden tables with benches are placed orderly. Its dishes are pretty attractive. My wife and I always order three dishes which are grilled fish, grilled potato and pork ribs and cold noodles. Grilled fish is served in a metal dish, peppered with pimiento and Zanthoxylum bungeanums and with some burning charcoal under it, which make it a good choice in cold days. The cold noodles are so called “黯然销魂面” because you cannot help tearing while eating it, the secrecy is the mustard in them. Although the two dishes are really delicious, only grilled potato and pork ribs can make us full owning to its quantity. This is the restaurant that I think is worth having a try. However, you had better go either early or late to avoid busy time if you do not want to wait in line.\n",

Although I am chinese I  have never been to Haikou. Do you guys know a chinese movie called <If You Are  The One Ⅱ> which is directed by a chinese director called Feng Xiaogang. The  view in this movie is beyond my imagination. By watching this film,I realise that both Beijing and Hainan are such wonderful places for traveling. Actually,I  have been to Beijing twice,however,comparing with what I have seen,It is more  charming obviously. Um.... well,I am a little bit upset but that is fine. I will  be back very soon in december. By the way,the weather in Auckland is freezing. I  struggle to weak up every day. I really hate weekdays,especially mondays. Here I got a picture of this movie which has shown a fantastic resort in Haikou  in this movie. I gotta go,see you tomorrow. Hang on,I suppose that most of you may know a chinese word which is 龍,because  I see some foreigners wear T-shirts that is painted this word on it. That is  quite interesting.

      "textContent--->People can solve important problems by themselves or with the help from their family members so there's no need for the government to help them. Some people may think without the government’s support, they still can solve some important problems by themselves or their families’ help. But I disagree. In my opinion, if we live without the help of the government, the life of us may be difficult and we may probably live in a chaotic society, just like that of primitive people. The first thing that the government helps us is about the social security. Without the government’s help, no one can imagine how mass our world would be. There may be plenty robberies, murders and even wars would be there. So without the government’s help, our world would be chaotic, how can a person solve important problems in that chaotic world? Second, the government keeps the safety of products and the price of some daily needs. They would send people to search for the unsafe products and tell the public as soon as they find it. Like the incident of plastic in Taiwan, China, if the government hadn’t told the public about the hazardous plastics, more and more babies would be poisoned by that plastic milk bottle. And think of the Japan earthquake, the salt price increased a lot after the explosion of nuclear station. People waited in lines to buy salt everyday. Then the government came out to say that the salt was actually from inner part of the land not the sea, and they also say that no one can rise the price of salt except the government themselves. They save our own interests. Last, the government tries to build a convenient and good-qualified society for us all. They built new subway lines, rebuilt some roads and dangerous buildings. Without their effort, our life can’t be so convenient as today’s. The government truly helps us solve plenty of important problems such as social security, the safety of products, the price of our daily needs and the transportation. Without the government’s help, no one can solve these problems by themselves or the help of their family members.\n",
      "textContent--->Should colleges ban house help 1.越来越多的大学生请钟点工打扫宿舍； 2.有的人赞同，有的人认为学校应该禁止这种做法； 3.我的观点； As we know,dormitory is a place for colleges to relax. In modern socity,peoples' lives conditiong getting more and more comfortable . Depending on their parents,many colleges hire house help in order to clear their dormitory. Different people hold differernt views on this thing. Some consider that it isn't bad for university students. Others disagree with it. Should colleges hire house help?Is it right or wrong for colleges hire house help? Many college students think that study are their first assignment. To start with,learning knowledge in the book is the most important thing in the campus. Moreover,They maintain that doing some house work is either wasting their time or hindering their study . For example,university student can use this time to learn more knowledge or rest. What's the most important,they believe the house help do better than theirseleves. Only cost little money,dorimtory will be clear and tidy immediately. Colleges required fresh environment to study so baning a house help is the best way to reach it. Not a few people argue that school should abandon colleages to ban a house help. Becuse house work as important as study. In the first place,It train us ablity and hardwork. In the second place,Hiring a house help instead of doing house work by theirselves will make me lazy in the furture. Last but not least,colleges don't spend any money . In my opinion,I oppose colleges hire a house help to clear their dormitory. If we can do,just do it. Do some house work are easy anf funny. It is essential to do some house work for college students. We can learn other different knowledege though doing house work.\n",

Without a glimpse at the weather reporting text message，I knew it was going to be a cloudy day today. As usual,the headache disappeared automatically after I had breakfast,but the dizziness was still bugging me. The walk to the nearest bus stop took me 20 minutes today. During the one-hour ride to downtown,I tried to finish the preview of the classes today,but failed because I was too sleepy. On the way to the small traditional chinese medical clinic,I felt that every breath I took was full of moisture. In fact,it was almost like walking in a big wet sponge. There was already 7 patient waiting in the corridor when I stepped into the clinic. The elderly doctor spent half a hour with one patient,and her worktime ends at 11:30. Knowing even if I waited there I still couldn't see the doctor without being late for the class,I decided to leave. The afternoon has't been any better than the morning.

The biting wind hooted, threatening to tear her over-washed while well-shaped clothes up, and the lunch box in her hand. Smoothing the gray hair, she raied her eyes, tiptoed to look further, and the winkled face was more like the face of a small child, happy and innocent, longing for something more important than candies or toys.

One man got lost in the forest. He wanted to know the time but he didn't have a watch. Then he saw two girls playing in the forest. He came to them to ask for the time. One girl was fat and the other was skinny. The elder sister speaks the truth in the morning, and lies in the afternnon. The younger sister lies in the morning, and speaks the truth in the afternnoon.(Could I use this sentence to replace my last sentence? \"It's opposite to the younger sister.\") When he asked, \"Which one of you is the older sister?\" The fat girl replied, \"Me\". So did the skinny girl. When he asked, \"It's morning or afternoon now?\" The fat girl replied, \"Afternoon\". But the skinny girl replied, \"No. It's morning.\" The man was confused. Which words they said were true, and which were lies? I gave an answer to this question which I thought was correct. But I think I did it wrong now. My friends from Lang-8, what's your answer?\n",

      "textContent--->PLEASE HELP TO CORRECT MISTAKES(((( People have different relationships with each other. In first all relationships built on trust. I think we should trust the people who are dear for us and we love. But if you want to have confidence between each other you should be honest. In my opinion it is one of the most important things between people. It is the key to all kinds' relationships. If you start to lie, it raises suspicious and mistrust. I think we should speak the truth even it is bitter. I consider that there is a not humane lie. Sooner or later, beyond all doubt, it will bring harm to anyone who believes in this delusion. On the one hand lied you can to hide the truth for a little time, but one the other hand if the truths come out? What you will do? By the way I think it will make your relationships worse or destroy them. As said Satin from the play By M. Gorkiy \"On the bottom\" -\"Lie even salvation-it is the clearest manifestation of disrespect to the person. And I agree with him. Of course on the one hand  keeping the honest and trusting relationships is hard work, but on the other hand it is the highest success of human relationships to which everyone should strive.\n",

      "textContent--->How to save time. Method of saving time (let’s escape from perfectionism) Find a little time and think, why do you check yourself many times, pay too much time and attention to things which could be done in one minute? Put down on the paper what disturbs you to work without mistakes and failures? Usually there is only one reason – dismay. It takes us into stress and disables to live normal life. (I am really in panic as I am afraid to make a mistake and always must check everything which  has been already done. Sometimes I even do not remember if I have completed something or not. I am afraid and ashamed not to keep my promises despite a can not cope with this all!) Make an analysis, how real are your fear. Is not it, may be even partly, the result of your own fantasy? Think, are you responsible enough for your job? The answer is positive off course. Then why do you keep yourself so tensed? How fatal are mistakes you may probably make doing your work? It is unlikely that world will be turned upside-down if you mistook sending required paper to wrong folder. Most of mistakes are correctable with more or less time spending! Find the balance with yourself, learn to respect yourself and your work. Do not be hurry neither with pronouncements, nor with actions. The work which is done quietly and thoroughly will give you satisfaction and as a result – self-reliance. Moreover, the quality of such work will me much better.\n",

She interviewed 32 founders of famous startups and big companies. Steve Wozniak from Apple, Charles Geschke from Adobe, Craig Newmark (the guy founded Craigslist) and so on. It is a beautiful journalistic creation but there are pits on the road. All of them founders are geniuses. So you're reading their bios and get something while examining their thoughts but cannot repeat their success. In some cases it is great reading but on the other hand - dull list of somebody's success stories.

Six years ago I had meet with a girl on the site of blogs and (as I've thought) fallen in love. I droped my job, leave my family and friends, and moved in the city there my intended wife lived. After six years of cohabitation, we broke off our relations, and I've come back in my city. When I rode to home (it was approximately 1,5k km) in a truck of my family's friend, I have a plenty time to think about what I learned and done in this years, and was it a waste of time or not. Now, I suppose that the time was not useless. I got some live experience, and I use to think, that all experience is usefull, not matter good it or bad.

      "textContent--->Tarkovsky  I’m reading Andrei Tarkovsky’s diaries. I usually don’t like to read something personal about famous people, because it often disturbs to interpret their art, but I made a little exception:) I know that Andrei is very famous all over the world. Here in Belarus very many people love his movies, too. I like his films very much, especially “Soliaris” and “The Mirror”. When he was alive he was considered as a real legend. However, his fate wasn’t kind. In the USSR he was half-forbidden. They let him make movies and even show them in movie theatres, but they were always putting incredible obstacles in his way. I’m sure that if Andrei had lived abroad, he would have made 40 or so movies. It was even funny when everybody in Europe knew Tarkovsky as the best Soviet filmmaker, and in the USSR they said him: “Andrei, your film is bad and obscure. You should do it over. Until that it’s not going to be shown”. Actually, I’m sure that in contemporary Belarus he wouldn’t make one single film, because they would say the same thing and he couldn’t resist that! It’s hard to read his diaries because he was quite a difficult person. He was angry and even inclined to misanthropy. He often criticized severely and even abused those who were by him and other’s creative works. He was cold. You can often read something like: “He died this morning. I should buy fruits today”. You would never think that he was like that judging by his humanistic films, but he really was. By the way, it’s strange why some genius works of art become famous and others don’t. For example, such Soviet filmmakers as Sokurov and Muratova aren’t worse than Tarkovsky, but very few people know about Sokurov and almost nobody knows about Muratova. I’m pretty sure that 99% of genius poetry and prose collect dust in bureaus.\n",

It was a time when the republic suffered from constant crisis and some people tried to capture the throne. He went step by step to his goal. And in year 58 b. c. he gets to the top of roman army in Gallia (modern France). He was a good warrior and politic. Soon Gallia became a roman province. Caesar became a very rich and he had a great and experienced army. He said why not? And one crossed Rubicon. It was a beginning of the civil war. It continued four years. Many times he was winner, but some times he could die. The Caesar army battled in Spain, France, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Egypt and Algeria. It was a world war of that time. After that he became an imperator and actually a king. He was famous like a very clement man. It was unusual in that time. But those people who were saved him during war killed him when he was alone and without arm. It was a very tragic lesson for next generations of lords.\n",

Nothing is forbidden for the Japanese child – he here only the werning: “it is dangerous”, “it is dirty”,  “it is bad”. But if is still hurt or burn himself, mother thinks that it’s her fault and apologize to him. Until five years the Japanese treat with a child like with a king, since 5 until 15 – like with a slave, after 15 – like with an equal. There is a method to bring up which is called “the lost child” or “maigo”. When a child is bored to be always attached to his mother, he started to appear an independence and a curiosity. He is given the possibility to be lusted.

It's very interesting, but quite difficult to remember such a big amount of letters or(how to say it) kanji ) I hope, people who use this site can give me a good advises about learning. Firstly a would like to install a programm to write japaneese on my computer, do you know where can i find it? Travelling around the Japan was amazing. I don't really believe we were in this far off country. The nature of Japan absorbs your attention and you are standing on the road in Tokio, open-mouthed, wondering with a speed of life. Everything we saw was done with a love and exactitude. The food is fantastic. But somewhy I thought that most of japaneese people don't like foreigners. They wewe friendly, but their smile was artificial. That is very sad. In a bookshop near of our hotel I bought a book となりのトトロ - I love it so much. I love reading and film art, and as far as I know Japan has a lot of literature that is worth read it.\n",

      "textContent--->Essay Hello i learn to write an essay but it is very difficult can you help me and correct mistakes?? Thank you The issue of education is always discussed in society. On the one hand all students must have equal opportunities and rights, but on the other hand free education creates high costs for taxi payers and government. It is therefore necessary to consider whether university education should not be free. Not everyone should pay all fees. Students from low-social background can have a lot of problem if they have to bear the high costs. They need a job to finance their university education, when their families can not help them financially. University education of these students suffers of the necessity to have a job. The supporters of free education demand that government take on the costs. University education gives benefits to the rest of society. The opponents mean that these costs are too high for government and taxi payers. If university education were being free some students could miss the lessons, while they paid for nothing and university education could be prolonged instead of five years to seven or more years. If students pay for education they are more motivated and try to give their best. The government can help students who can not pay for university education and give them a loan. Free education is not good for the country and government. For example, foreign students study at a university and return from abroad to home. Government invested in education, but government did not make profit from that. University education should not be free because it is not profitable for the country and government. Good university education is expansive, but educated people have better prospects to find a good job.\n",

      "textContent--->Me again Well, long time no see. =) How long has it been? Almost a year? Well, a baby doesn't leave you much free time. My son is nine months old now. His name is Yaroslav, just like his grandfather's. But I have lots of other names for him. He was born exactly three years after my marriage. So, we have three reasons to celebrate that day: I met my husband, married him and gave birth to our son on the same day! Yarik can stand on his feet and even walk with my assistance. He has six teeth and one more is coming. He is his father's copy and he's the cutest boy I've ever seen. He smiles a lot, dogs make him laugh. He likes tomatoes. No, he adores tomatoes! He could sell his soul for just one little bite of tomato! =)) He's a very busy child, you can never see him sitting idly, he's always crawling somewhere - there's so much to see, to do and to learn! I had to give up origami, because he shows too much interest in small pieces of paper. I took up knitting instead. Yarik likes balls of yarn as much as pieces of paper, but at least he can't eat them. =)) Life has changed dramatically after his birth. The most difficult thing was to put up with the fact, that I no longer belong to myself. My son owns me \"completely and entirely\". He doesn't care if I'm tired, hungry or sick. He wants me no matter what. As soon as I accepted this fact, everything got much easier. So now I simply enjoy the time I spend with him, because in a couple of years he will become more independent and won't need me that much.\n",
      "textContent--->environmental protection: problems and tasks Environmental protection is the main problem that mankind faces nowadays. One of the most serious problems is pollution of land (soil pollution), water and air with different wastes. The reason is that the society produces too much package, litter and garbage that is dumped in the streets or accumulated on either litter tips or landfill sites. As a result streets are being made dirty and diseases are spreading quicker. People should use dustbins and dispose litter in designated areas. Besides, we have to recycle refuse such as scrappaper, bottles, clothes etc. dumped chemicals can lead to lung diseases and even a threat of skin cancer. Yet another problem is deforestation. As a result of it the amount of oxygen reduces. Scientists are worried about changes of weather. Climate is changing very quickly due to global warming. The growing number of automobiles  produce car exhaust fumes  that also assist the greenhouse effect. Environmental deterioration takes badly its toll on people's  and animals' health. If we don't stop abusing nature, it can end up in a complete depletion of natural recources and a disaster for humanity.\n",

      "textContent--->abstracts 1)The article analyzes the operations of temporary work agencies dealing with the provision of workforce as well as the normative enactments applicable to such labour relations and requirements stipulated in the European Union law. The aim of the article is to analyze the working principles and legal regulations (incl. enhancement of contractual relations) at the temporary work agencies as well as to investigate the issues analyzed in the directive. Although Directive 2008/104/EK “on temporary agency work” entered into force since November 19th , 2008, Latvia still does not have a clearly defined status of a temporary worker or the type of work dealing with provision of such labour force and such relations are regulated by the general provisions of the Labour law that unfortunately do not provide for the requirements laid out in the European Union law. The employment and contractual obligations are unclear and legislators urgently have to amend the legal provisions in order to ensure equal treatment, labour protection and qualitative work for temporary agency workers. 2) The article is devoted to detention in the criminal trial of the Republic of Latvia. \tDetention takes the leading place in the system of measures of judicial compulsion, which has been depicted in the article. Meanwhile, having common features with the measures of judicial compulsion, detention is exclusive. \tThe author of the article has made an attempt to examine the reason, conditions and grounds of detention of suspect in crime commitment according to the ways of detention provided by Criminal Procedure Law. 3) Border checks on the land external border of the Republic of Latvia are performed in accordance with the Schengen Convention, Schengen Borders Code, Visa Code, Border Guard Law, State Border Law of the Republic of Latvia, Immigration Law, and other laws and regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers, which were issued in accordance with the above mentioned laws. The present article covers some contradictions and drawbacks of the legal regulation concerned the terminology in use and correspondence of the national legal regulations to the international obligations. There are fifteen border crossing points with the extremely high intensity of people and cargo flow on the external land borders of Latvia. This fact determines the necessity to harmonise the legal regulation, and the aim of the author is to describe the legal requirements related to the crossing of the external borders.\n",
      "textContent--->Educational system in Kazakhstan Educational system in Kazakhstan differs from American or Britain. At the age of two or tree children can go to a kinder-garden but it is not necessarily. The children stay in the kinder-garden the  whole day. They eat, sleep and learn there. They learn different things about surrounding world,  numbers and letters. At the age of five they start writing. But they write only simple elements, like circles and lines. Not all children can go to the kinder-garden. It is difficult to get place there. Parents often queue when the child is not even born! And it is expensive. So, many children stay at home until they are six. From six years they have to go to school. Children who visited a kinder-garden go strait to the first form, but those who didn't must go th the preparatory classes first. There they study everything children study in a kinder-garden and it is free. At the elementary school children study with one teacher from the first up to the fourth forms. They study mathematics, Russian (as a native language in Russian schools and Kazakh as a native language in Kazakh schools), “cognition of surrounding world” (I don't know how to translate it correctly. It is a subject, combining biology, geography, social science and history, the simplest and fundamental topics from all this subjects), art, music, and self – actualization. It is a new subject. It is studied in all forms at school and  is something like physiology, but it is not a psychology in the ordinary sense  of the word. Children learn here how to communicate with others, how to be good and kind,  how to see beauty and help others to see it too. From the fifth form children go the a grammar school. They study there five years and it is often placed in the same building   with elementary school. They study mathematics, native language, foreign language (mostly English but there are a few schools where children study German and French), physics, biology, geography, history of Kazakhstan and the world's history, religions (here they learn about different religions existing in the world from the secular point of view). Every subject they have once or twice a week, so they can have six or sometimes seven different subjects a day. In all forms children study Kazakh language  in Russian schools and Russian language in Kazakh. After the ninth form children can leave school for a college or they can go to the high school and study there for two years more. If they go to a college, they study all the high-school program during the first year there and only from the second year they study special subjects. After the eleventh form children pass a big exam, a test, which takes place in a one day in the whole country. Whith the results of this test children can go to a university or a college. If they go to a college after the 11th form they study one year less.\n",

I came to her and told about my situation. I do not have a job, and it is hard to find something good in our small town. She said that she knew a man who is a big businessman. And she was going to speak about me, she tried that he gave me a job. I talked 2 times to him and, in my opinion, he did not want to take me. However, I suppose he could not refuse her request. He owns hardware stores network. These stores are situated in many cities in Kazakhstan and abroad. The one position he was ready to offer was a seller. I had no choice. As more that year I have not worked. Moreover, the financial situation is worsening. Father is jobless. I also have not been earning for a long time. As a consequence, only my mother gets money and pays all expenditures. So, I had to accept his offer. Besides, I have something to share. But unfortunately, I am so tired now and ging to sleep.\n",
      "textContent--->Philosophy Existentialism - scope of philosophy recognizing the true reality of being a single human personality. It has taken shape under the influense of social cataclysms of the 20th century. A man tends to his individual aims, creates himself, chooses methods and forms of their life. But in everyday life people can misunderstanding himself, they try to be like everyone else avoiding responsibility and freedom. The modern existentialism experienced the impact of phenomenology and found many threads related to the philosophy of life. The most prominent representatives of existentialism, where the founders was the Russian  philosophers Berdyaev and Shestov, were the German thinker - Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers, the French ones - Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, Spanish -  Juan Ortega y Gasset.\n",

The Japanese list has about 1000 pages, and all the entries have a lot of views, the average number is about 20.

Actually, there generally aren't mountains at all )). But in the suburbs we have several places which would be good for teaching skiing- Not tall, steep, slick slopes. But you should totally forget about freeriding. Of course there are even signboards like \"Wild slope\"... but... you know... it's ridiculous))). On weekends in May I went out of the polar circle to the mountains called Hibiny. Oh, there really are a lot of wild slopes with the threat of avalanches there! Magnificent fresh snow, the sun was shining... uninhabited... What else do you need for great skiing? So I had really unforgettable weekends. This year I'm going to go skiing in the Alps or maybe I'll stay in Russia and go skiing in Elbrus - these are two fundamentally different types of skiing! In Europe, of course, you'll have good and expensive service and tall, slick slopes, and in Elbrus or in Cheget there aren't any services and you can have a great freeride there (on slopes which don't know what \"snowcat\" means))). It just depends on my friends. But my greatest dream will always be wild Alaska. I know, skiing there is almost impossible for me, but ski movies about it are really impressive!\n",

      "textContent--->How I chose boots for Sasha and didn’t choose anything The problem of choice is facing us every day. We choose our profession, the style of life, friends and such usual things like food or clothes. Perhaps the most long-term and silly choice is a choice of clothes. Because we waste long time for find that we want. As for me I like shopping,  I like to help to my friends to do the shopping but I find that It is an impermissible luxury to waste much money and time for this process. But like almost every girl I do shopping regularly. So I want to describe you my last shopping day. It was yesterday. I went with my new friend Sasha to choose boots for him. I had never helped anybody to buy men’s boots. It was my first experience. In the beginning of this story I want to tell the truth that of course we didn’t find anything. Sasha and I had a special taste and to be honest I wasn’t a good adviser. May be I felt shy, may be, there were no good boots in the shop that looked like market, may it wasn’t our day) But I get pleasure from this shopping day. We went to the new shopping center named Europe and looked different video installations. I liked the last one and the video about the destiny of Islamic women.

      "textContent--->My psychology progect As I know that a good beginning is half the battle, I started from the bag. I tried to make it pretty and cute, but without too much glitter. I want to make an impression that I am kind, helpful and optimistic, that’s why I chose flowers and  butterflies to add on my bag. Something of interest to me I am really proud of my native country, city, parents and friends. I add flag, as a symbol of Russia, church as a symbol of my native city- it is the most famous place in Yaroslavl. Also, I add the photo of my Mom, because she is the main part of my family. On the background of this photo there is the best and the most famous university in Russia. On that day I came there to write a contest, because my  composition was chosen as one of the best in our country, this is one more thing, I am proud of . And the last photo-my friends and me. These people are very important for me, because with them every day brings something new and positive. With a support I can do almost everything, I think, and my friends give it to me to the full, when I need it. Sometimes I certainly miss these places and people, that’s why these photos are in this section. Something important to me I tell you my story. In the childhood I was really my father’s daughter. I could listen to his stories eternally and his opinion was the most important in the world. One day he presented me a yellow bookmark with a picture of a cat on it. That simple gift was so unexpected and cute, that I was very happy. I keep that bookmark for 10 years already. And also, since that day, cats are my favorite animals. A small thing of great importance. Music that I like and that represents me     \t I can play the guitar. You know, music for me it is something indescribable, a mystery. Dad played the guitar and sang songs to me. We had our special song, which we composed together. When the guitar appeared in his arms, everything lost any sense. And that charm of music was the main reason why I began to attend my guitar class. After my guitar teacher found out that I can sing well and since then I fell in love with not easy, but so beautiful jazz music. I always sing: when I washing the dishes, when I taking a shower, when I doing my homework etc. Something that I think represents psychology\t Psychology for me-science, which helps people to understand themselves, to foresee dangerous places of  life. Also, I think we need to study psychology to found out deep motivations and develop knowledge that we will use in the future career and family life. This picture represents processes in our mind. And it is the most interesting part of psychology, I think- to understand how everything works.\n",

Mdina is called \"The Silent City\" because only a limited number of inhabitans'cars,emergency and wedding cars are  allowed in Mdina. It's great!!!! It is considered that apostle Paul,the founder of the Christianity,landed here after the ship-wreck. Sightseeings: the Main Gateway of Mdina, the Greek Gates, St. Paul's Cathedral, Carmelite Church, the Mdina's Dungeon. The first thing which we saw when we left the bus have arrived in Mdina was the statue of a loving couple,illuminated against the night sky. It was very romantic! then we saw the fantastic garden consisted from intricate trees through we could see the majestic main gateway of Mdina. It impressed me a lot! within two hours we were enjoying the narrow streets of the silent city astinishing the original Mdina's arhitecture. Suddendly I saw the open door in one of the Pallazzo and when i saw the ancient furniture with fretwork I decided that it was a museum. I asked a man who was inside if we could come in and have a look. Inside on the first floor there were a lot of portreits of young beatiful women with flowers and a little tiny garden on the backyard with armchairs under palms. On the second floor there were two refined bedrooms\n",

Just imagine: no public transport , more sleep , no rushing off to work , no tiresome coworkers to be friendly when you're having a bad mood, but as everything it has drawbacks.

It's appreciable saving of money . In addition to , a home working personliterally goes to work in their PJ's. Working at home doesn's work for everyone. When you work from home you don't have collegues or coworkers to share professional ideas. There's nobody to help you in solving professional problems.

Application of modeling and forecasting capabilities in analytical tools of the risk management system in the Federal Customs Service In present-day conditions risk management in the Federal Customs Service of the RF is connected with handling and analyzing a large amount of different information on retrospective, real and predictable state of key indicators in foreign trade and activity of customs authorities. To effectively support making decisions in the risk management field, software tools of analysis, modeling and forecasting can be used. In whole, the application field of such tools can be different depending on problems to solve - from local tools for producing short-term forecasts with several key indicators to complex full-featured systems of modeling and forecasting covering hundreds of interrelated indicators (including key ones) with different activities. Such systems are used in a number of companies, financial institutions and public authorities. Nowadays one of the important goals in the Federal Customs Service of Russia is management of violation risk of the customs legislation. The problems of risk management system improvement in the Federal Customs Service of Russia take the centre stage. That becomes particularly important in current economic condition when goods turnover and receipt of money from customs payments in the federal budget are decreasing. In addition, some people, who transfer goods, tend to “optimize” their expenses in customs registration of goods. Analytical tools of the risk management system are in the high light as just well-organized thorough analysis and modeling all information at hand on goods, transport means, documents and persons allow making efficient decisions and holding successful activities for customs surveillance. Efficient application of modeling and forecasting tools in the process of analysis and risk management is one of the components of successful work for abatement of damage from violation customs legislation. To solve such problems an automated system which supports decisions making in the field of analysis and risk management, is created and implemented in the Federal Customs Service of Russia. This system ensures modeling and forecasting the degree of divergence in statistics indicators of foreign trade which in turn can be potentially connected with an unreliable goods declaring. Technological subsystems of the developed program feature include the above-mentioned data storage as well as an administration and audit subsystem, a data upload subsystem and a reference data running. Functional block of data analysis and models plot area management allows experts analyzing indicators connected with risks presented in different profiles (goods, countries, customs authorities and others) and generated with data from different sources. Examples of analyzed indicators are volume of foreign trade in monetary and weight terms, amount of customs payments, volume of goods production and consumption in Russia, significance of differences in statistics data. The hallmark of this analysis is that by their results a localized list of goods and countries that will be used in modeling and forecasting is formed. For analysis the capabilities of multidimensional Express-Analysis (OLAP), specific report forms which ensure data visualization in charts and business graphics (including electronic maps of areas).\n",

      "textContent--->Learning Grammar Doesn't Help Me to Speak With English-Spea​king People. Due to the growing cultural exchange and internationa​l communicatio​n during the last century, learning foreign languages has become one of the most essential demands of our society, and can be compared with overall computer study. Being so widely spread throughout the world, language learning reveals lots of problems as people with different cultural background and unequal personal abilities expose themselves to foreign languages, bearing in mind various purposes and reasons: from elementary speaking skills for travelling abroad to academic writing, business language and learning just for fun included. Such diverse aims of language study required a great deal of assorted teaching techniques which were actually tried on during 1950s-80s. At that time grammar seemed to be the only obstacle in teaching speaking. Indeed, after having spent boring labourious years on grammar drills most of the students failed to produce even a comparativel​y short fluent utterance. It became evident that drilling separate grammar issues did not contribute much to intonation, rhythm and pronunciatio​n which may alter the connotation of the word or phrase. Learning grammar rules somehow prevented from using “functional language” which should be practised in guided speaking activities and ‘real-life’ situations. So, grammar was vigorously rejected; first – by native language teachers, then – from foreign language classes as well. New communicativ​e approach, offering grammar skills through reading/spea​king activities, proved its attraction to students as they got highly motivated and started speaking as if by magic. Proclaiming grammar a useful tool, the teachers applied numerous activities to link phrasal verbs, prepositions​, idioms and collocations​ with images, emotions or situations in minds of their students. Acquiring fluent speaking in target language became the feature of this method. Later with much discontent researchers noted a correlation between the decline in teaching traditional grammar and a decline in test scores and poor writing skills, as naturally it is easier to speak language then to write. Favouring creative skills rather than productive led to inaccuracy in speech, both spoken and written. Another complication​ in language teaching is caused by simplifying tendency via the Internet. Offering billions of free language learning resources, the Internet lacks in focusing on proper language – since people manage to understand each other they pay no attention to grammar accuracy or enriching vocabulary. In many ways, the debate pros and cons traditional teaching approach has created a negative view of grammar. That is a pity. The best reasons for teaching grammar are positive. It seems logical that grammar should be taught together with speaking/lis​tening. At lower stages learning grammar creates a sense of successful studying, which is very important for further motivation. Investigatin​g grammar rules, describing forms and functions introduce students into communicativ​e speaking from the very beginning, when they are not trained enough to discuss other topics. It is well known that traditional grammar teaching creates better and more accurate writers, whereas writing is considered to be one of main steps in mastering speaking. So, one may say, that now we are facing a ‘back to basics’ alarm. The truth is in the middle, as usual.\n",

      "textContent--->What Siberian Cities look like? Like almost all inhabitants of my hometown, Barnaul, I was pretty sure that I lived in a small town. It had a population of 650 000. When my English improved so I could communicate with people from other countries, my international friends didn't understand why I considered the Barnaul city a small town. The reason was that near Barnaul, there was a Novosibirsk city with a population of over 1 million. To the West, there was another city -- Omsk with a population of over 1 million. To the East, there was Krasnoyarsk city, that has a population of about 1 million. Indeed, Barnaul was like a suburban village compared to other Siberian cities. To my surprise, in Europe and North America the scale of what is a large city and what is not, differs much from mine. Now I realize that Barnaul, though not being the largest city in Siberia, is quite a big industrial center with well-developed infrastructure. Wooden houses are not common for Siberian cities. Normally, private houses are built from bricks, we call them cottages. Often, cottage communities are separated from the rest of the city and located in the suburban areas. The vast majority in Siberia lives in condos (like these ones in the pictures). During 1960th, the Soviet government deployed a country-wide construction program that had to solve the shortage for residential real estate in cities. Since then typical, rather ugly condos raised all across country. Siberia was not an exception. According to the Soviet government, it was a temporary solution, but, like Russians used to say, there's nothing more permanent than temporary solutions. These condos still serve to people, and more new condos were built during last 20 years. During the World War II, many industrial enterprises and factories were evacuated from the European part of Russia to Siberia by the rail way. While Western Russia were at high risk of being occupied, Siberia seemed a pretty safe place. Most factories in Barnaul and Novosibirsk are ones of those that were moved there during the WWII. Since then Western Siberia is an important industrial region with predominantly urban population.\n",

      "textContent--->New Year Holiday In Russia New Year is one of the most important holidays in Russia. I bet, every family in Russia stays awaken at least until 1 am at night from December 31st  to January 1st , watching TV, eating delicious things and drinking champagne (or/and something else, but champagne is a must). *New Year vs Christmas* The Soviet Union was officially an atheistic country, where religious holidays were prohibited. In many families the tradition of celebrating Christmas was lost after the Revolution of 1917. However, the need for bright, magical winter holiday remained, and soon Christmas has replaced by New Year. Most Christmas attributes were adopted by the New Year holiday, like a decorated coniferous tree, gifts, heavy dinner, lights, garlands and firecrackers. Until now New Year is more popular and widely celebrated than Christmas in Russia. *New Year Tree* Families with kids normally decorate a New Year tree. Artificial trees are still not so popular in Russia (well, at least, in Siberia) because, first, many fir farms in Russia plant trees specially for the New Year, and second, artificial trees has no smell. The smell of fir for me is a symbol of the holiday since my early childhood, and without this magical smell the New Year is sort of defective. The most popular tree trimming decorations are baubles of various colors, tinsels, electric light garlands and a star on the top. When I was a kid, little toy bears, birds, glass icicles and snow-men toys were also widely used, but during last ten years, I can not find such toys in supermarkets and stores. May be, this is because Russian industry stopped producing native glass New Year toys, and most toys are imported ones. By the way, we do not use ribbons in Russia for decoration. Many cities and towns manage to decorate an open-air New Year Tree. In places like Siberia, where winters are cold enough, the entire snow towns rise at the main squares with the New Year tree in the center. Places that are not so lucky, put large inflatable dolls of Ded Moroz, Snegurochka and snowmen (see picture). *New Year Characters* The central character of the New Year holiday is Ded Moroz (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ded_Moroz). His name could be literally translated as Grandfather Frost. He plays a role similar to that of Santa, i. e. bring presents to children, but he does it in person, during the new year parties for kids that are organized in every day-cares and schools. However, these presents (mostly sweets) are not so important. A child finds his or her main present laying under the New Year tree early in the morning in January 1st. Ded Moroz wears a heel-long fur coat, a semi-round fur hat. Unlike Santa Claus, he walks with a long magical staff, does not say \"Ho, ho, ho,\" and drives troika. or just walks. Snegurochka (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snegurochka) or 'Snow Maiden,' is a granddaughter of Ded Moroz. She is kind and beautiful, with long blond hairs. Often the New Year fairy-tales and shows have a plot developed around the same situation: naive Snegurochka has got into troubles and a protagonist rescue her with the help of spectators. *The Dinner* There are no traditional New Year dishes in modern Russia, however, since the Soviet time, the Russian salad is somewhat mandatory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_salad). In Russia and CIS it is called Olivier by Lucien Olivie, a chef who invented the recipe of a salad, however, the modern Olivier has nothing in common with the dish that was so popular in Moscow of 1860s. Butterbrots with caviar, salmon fish, sausages are very common, I believe, for all Russia's provinces. The main dish can be fried chicken (the whole chicken or parts), pork, beef – actually, everything. In the Soviet Unions the smell of tangerines was one if the New Year's attributes. The reason is that there were standard New Year gifts for kids that included chocolate (natural dark chocolate only, no substitutes), candies, one big apple and tangerines or/and orange. Those gifts smelled like heaven and the dominant note was, of course, a tangerine. As I said above, champagne is a special New Year beverage. It doesn't mean that this is the only popular alcohol for the New Year party. Actually, people drink everything during the party, but right in the midnight, families and friends gather around the table, stand up and clink glasses with champagne wishing each other healthy, happy and prosperous new year. Happy New Year!\n",

      "textContent--->Is it bad or good? Now I want to tell you a story. I think it’s not a story it’s a parable. It happened many-many years ago. One man lived in the small mountain village with his son. He was very proud  having a beautiful white horse. The one unhappy day came and this horse went to the mountains and was be lost. All neighbors were so sorry about this loss. They said that it’d been very bad accident. But our man was a kind of wise man who was not quick to conclusion. He answered for them: “ I don’t know that’s bad or good”. And he didn’t look worry. After time his horse came back to home and then it was known that she was pregnant. Then our man had two horses. All his neighbors though that it was happy case. But he didn’t it now again. And he didn’t look happy. After time when his horse had made labor and foal grew up his son was riding  fell from young horse  and broke his leg. Doctor said that he would be lame all last life. What you think what our man said and what all his neighbors said. You will be right if you think that all neighbors regretted about this news and our man didn’t  again know it was bad or good. Time flights. And country where lived our hero had began the war. All young men from the village were taken to the army except lame gay. That was a reason why all mans’ neighbors were envious for him. But a man was not worry. He said: “ I don’t know that’s bad or good”. This story hasn’t the end. Because each event might be good or bad in the same time. It depends from the point of view to the life. So what do you think about this thought?\n",

      "textContent--->Easy to chat and hard to speak? I use Skype very active, especially for speaking with relatives or friends. But I've noticed, that some people prefer to chat rather than to speak. I knew, that people are divided into 3 groups of the way they perceive information: by hearing, writing and loooking. I s'pose, that I do it better by hearing, cos I used to play piano for many years and only way to learn big music works is to play it many times and listen to it often. So. About Skype. I like to speak on Skype cos I can hear the voice, and a few people can control their voice. Facial expressions - may be. But voice - harder. I endeavor to do it, especially when I speak to not familiar people to me, or with those, who are not friendly to me. You can guess about emotions of your companion and true feelings. You can hear second sense in their words. BUT! When you chat, many things can be missed. And some people benefit from it. But I don't like it definitely!\n",

Don't confuse it with \"The Notebook\" by Nicholas Sparks or with Agatha Christie. ;) In reviews this book is called \"the most pitiless book of the last century\". This is story of twins living with their grandmother's house in the Little Town during the WW II. But this books isn't about the War. It's story of two boys who adapt to the cryel world. They do special exercises to numb their feelings. This book isn't nice. It took us through all the dirt, bestiality, cruelty. Even I can't stadn such thing this book is the best book I've ever read. \"The Notebook\" is amazing thing and I strongly recomend you to read this.

      "textContent--->Pelting rain Once again, practice in translation. It's raining in my town now, so the atmosphere is favourable. “Pelting rain” by Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol  Damp, pelting rain was pouring when I left the house. Gray, smoky sky foreboded the rain to last. There was not even a ray of light; a gray veil with no tear in it. Moving net of the rain caught almost everything, that the eye had met before, and only houses on the front of the street  flickered as if seen through gauze. Dimly flickered a sign upon a sign, even more dimly flickered  balcony above them, and finally, one more floor higher, the roof almost lost in the rainy fog and only the watery shine slightly distinguished  it from the air; water murmured in the pipes. Puddles on the pavement. Damn, I love times like this. Not a fellow on a street. Now there is not a sign  of those gentleman, who stop to examine your boots, trousers, tailcoats or hat, and after that, with their mouths wide open, look back few times to scrutinize your derriere. Now I am free to wrap in the coat tightly. Look, some nice young lad, with a face you can easily shove into  ladies' reticule, runs in vain hopes of saving his new frock-coat, the beauty and the loveliness of the whole Nevsky Prospect. Pour harder, rain, make him return home as wet as a rat. Ah, here's a grand dame running in her motley rags, dress is lifted up to the last point where the decencies allow, where has her temper gone? She doesn't mind when some bureaucrat  in uniform with order, with his eyes as green as his uniform, staring at her obese thighs, trembling like a jelly at her every step. Oh, those bastards! They are aces, those bureaucrats, to catch a fish in a dirty water. Come rain, snow or sunny day- you will find this amphibian on a street. Every minute his collar changes its color with temperature just like chameleon, but he himself stays the same, like his bureaucratic procrastination. Here comes a  Russian-beard, a merchant in a german blue frock-coat with waist somewhere on a back, or better, on the neck. With such a business grip he holds an umbrella above his mistress. How pants this pile of meat, wrapped in housecoat and cap. She can be classified rather as a mollusc than vertebrate animal. Rain harder, I beg you, rain on his german frock-coat and grease meat of this feather-bed inhabitant. God, what an awful smell of cabbage and onion they have left. Pour on them, rain, for their wickedness, for this beard's shameless  trickery, for cupidity, for his beard full of lice and for his bestial mistress... Nonsense! They won't feel a policeman's punch, what raindrops can do. Anyway, we haven't had such rain for a long time. It became stronger, and now falls straight down as if trying to bring this marsh town lower to the ground. Windows of confectioner's shops are closed. Heads with mustaches and pipes, the last one to stand, hid. Even the gray knight with halberd and bandaged cheek hurried to his sentry box.\n",

As for me, I can't say that I am stressed out person. But we are living in such world where it is impossible to live without stress. I think that the most stressful situation for me is making a speech. I am always anxious about it. I always lick my lips and then they are not nice looking:) During the speech I can forget some words. It can be simply and very important word and it seems that I lost it and can't find.

      "textContent--->Home reading I'm having a special Home Reading lesson tomorrow. So I read a book. It's one of “Quick Reads” books. And now I must write a synopsis. So I decided to write it here: A Dream Come True. Her name is Maggie. She works part-time for travel agency. She is forty three and she lives in Liverpool with her husband and their dog. His name is John. He is a teacher in school and he spends much time on the work. They haven't any children and he is the only person who called her by her full name Margaret. These are the facts influences on a lot of facts in this book. In the beginning of the book she arrives to the conference in Brighton and mets there Connor. He is from Manchester, married with tree children. He's woks for travel agency too. But it was his own agency. It was, but both of their agencies is bought by the “Buzz” corporation. It's a long time since people had told Margaret she is pretty. And now Connor has and she feels something new. May be it's not a love, but it's what can make a woman happy. They have a smashing time in Brighton. But it's time to go home. And Connor says he'll call and they'll meet one more time without fail. But let's talk about someone else. Because there are some other characters in book. And one of them is Maggie's  boss, Hugh Miller. He is worried that he would lose his job because Buzz can employ their own staff at his agency. And his suspicions comes true. Felix Anderson, the founder of Buzz, chooses Maggie to be the manager in Buzz in Liverpool. But she decide to change her job. But it isn't the reason for Felix to make Hugh his employee. And one more about Hugh. He loves Maggie and he'll be one of the elements in her family tragedy. The next character is Maggie's friend Tess. And it's one more family tragedy. She lives alone with four children. And they make a lot of problems to her. One of them is her daughter Clare. She leaves home, when she is pregnant. And returns only with child, without child's father. And the last character in this book is Connor's wife Emma. She doesn't want to sacrifice her work to children. So they have some problems with their little boy, and it doesn't make their marriage happier. And now we return to Maggie's story. She has been waiting a call from Connor for a few days. And he calls. They meets in the restaurant in Liverpool while they spouses are busy. It isn't good rendezvous so Maggie decides that it is their last meeting. Then her relations with her husband gets cold. And ones he knows true. Hugh tells him about Maggie's relations with Connor. But she go out with Connor one more time when both of them admits that they shouldn't meet any time again. And while they talk about it someone phones Connor. Emma crashes the car and gets into hospital with their little Harry. Connor goes out. But it's all right with Emma and Harry and Connor and Maggie understands that he's goes out of her live forever. At the same time John turns out the bigger scoundrel than you can think. Maggie catches him with his lover in her mother's house. John has been in relationships with teacher from his school for five years. So Maggie decides to get a divorce. And finally Tess's children at home, her daughter Clare finds her daughter's father and arrives with him. And Maggie lives in her mother's house, associates with her neighbors, works at home for NOMA and she's in a familiar way.\n",

      "textContent--->Hallo! Guten Tag, die Benutzer von Lang-8. Das ist mein erster Eintrag auf diesem Website. Soweit ich verstehe, darf man hier um Hilfe mit der Sprache man lernt bitten. Eine wunderbare Möglichkeit, die gerade zur rechten Zeit gekommen ist! In einigen Tagen werde ich die Prüfung für Goethe-Zertifikat C1 auflegen. Um die zu bestehen versuche ich die Aufgaben von vorherigen Jahren zu machen. Eine von diesen ist immer Beschreibung einer Grafik. Ich wäre Ihnen äußerst dankbar, wenn sie diesen Text überfliegen werden, um mich auf meine Fehler zu verweisen. (Dass der Umfang nicht eingehaltet ist weiß ich.) Auf jeden Fall lege ich auch die Grafik an. Darf man übrigens so kategorisch in der Prüfung schreiben? Ich bin keine Aktivistin für gleiche Rechte, ich hatte beim Schreiben einfach Angst davon, dass ich meine Gedanken nicht klar genug äußern werde. --- Die Grafik zum Thema „Einkommensunterschiede zwischen Männer und Frauen“ zeigt, wie viel Geld bekamen für ihre Arbeit Männer und Frauen in Deutschland im Vergleich zur EU 1999 und 2004. Auf der Grafik ist besonders auffällig, dass das Unterschied beim Einkommen von weiblichen und männlichen Arbeitern in der EU allgemein in der Zeitperiod von 1999 bis 2004 sich weniger verändert hat, als in Deutschland. Es ist auch zu erkennen, dass im Unterschied zu Deutschland wurde in der EU die Durchschnittslohn von Frauen größer. Aus meiner Sicht ist diese Situation nicht zu tolerieren, deshalb beurteile ich positiv, dass in der EU allgemein die Arbeitsgeber die richtige Entscheidungen getroffen haben. Obwohl in der EU beginnen die Arbeitsgeber die Arbeit von Frauen und Männern gleich zu schätzen,  sind die Behörde von Deutschland leider noch nicht genug tolerant, wie ich sie sehen möchte. Meiner Meinung nach sind die Vorurteilen der alten Zeiten der Grund dieser Ungleichheit. Die Männer einschätzen die Vertreter anderes Geschlechts als irrationell, und deshalb glauben sie, dass eine Frau nie kompetent genug für ihres Amt sein könnte. Ich denke, dass diese Vorurteilen nicht mehr ein Teil modernes Leben sein darfen. Es wäre ganz nützlich, wenn objektive Statistik von Ergebnissen der weiblichen Beamten mitgeteilt würde, sodass die Arbeitsgeber keine Angst davon haben, einer Frau Arbeit zu geben. Leider ist der Bevölkerung von Lettland bekanntlich das bedauernswertes Wesen: die obenerwähnte Vorurteilen bestehen noch in der Gesellschaft. Mann kann, z. B., in technischen Bereichen sehr oft von Situationen hören, wenn eine Frau eine kleinere Lohn bekommt, als ihrer Kollege im dieselben Amt. Außerdem absagen häufig die Arbeitsgeber, weibliche Spezialisten auszuwählen,  und statt diese Frauen bekommen die Arbeit Männer, die dieselbe Qualifikationen haben. Abschließend möchte ich sagen, dass die Tendenz, die EU demonstriert, Optimismus einflößt, und wird dasselbe hoffentlich in allen Länder Europas passieren.\n",

      "textContent--->Island of Crimea By Vasiliy Aksenov Language, myths, legends and fairy tales are good sources of information for those who study collective unconscious archetypes. There is a very Russian word “тоска” [taskAh] that means a melancholy and longing for something incomprehensible at the same time. And there is an old myth about the Buyan island, where there are a lot of magic things, eternal glory and, what is most important, an absolute justice for all. This island was the exact opposite to the miserable real life. So for centuries, Russian people had been planting in their hearts the longing for the ideal place. The Soviet Union was separated from the rest of the world by the iron curtain, so many Soviet people put their Buyan island to abroad, to the inaccessible capitalistic countries. My grandfather dreamed about visiting Paris one day, knowing pretty well that he would never cross the boarder of the Soviet Union. My parents, like many other Soviet people, used to think about the “Western world” as about the land where everything is much better than in Russia, where the most poor guy has good clothes and tasty food, where houses are large and people are friendly and honest. The “Western world” was their Buyan island. My generation has to find a new place to put our dream land on, because what is accessible, is no longer ideal. A Russian novelist Vasily Aksenov (Василий Павлович Аксёнов) wrote the Island of Crimea in 1979. It was the time when Russian society lived in the world of double standards. The difference between the official propaganda and the real situation was schizoid-like. On the one hand, Soviet people condemned the capitalistic world for racism, exploitation and wrong moral principles, but on the other hand, many people dreamed about travelling to abroad and buying all those symbols of the bright life like jeans and tape recorders. Nowadays, we have everything available in our supermarkets, so my niece would hardly understand what does it mean — to dream about a pair of jeans. Aksyonov built his \"Island of Crimea\" on an interesting premise. What if Crimea were an island, instead of a peninsula. Further more, what if Crimea was the only area of Greater Russia to hold out against the Reds, and become a multy-ethnic \"free\" zone? It is not a novel of the alternative history, but a novel of alternative geography instead. The mythical Buyan Island was put into the Island of Crimea. So some limited amount of people got an opportunity to live in the conditions that they were dreaming about. Are they happy finally? Not at all. The Island enjoys capitalism (like Hong Kong), but many want to rejoin Russia. The brightest and the smartest Crimean people are petting the idea of the so called “Common Fate”. Their hearts are longing for “the Big Motherland”, they consider their richness and happiness as false values and want to suffer as much as people behind the iron curtain. Also, there is a group of youngsters who want to have their own identity, a Russian-Tatar mix called Yaki. The society is splitting into conflicting groups, so instead of the Eden, they get Hell one day. The Island of Crimea is a perfect guideline to deceitful and seducing ideology of the Soviet Union. The book also contains a bitter and merciless portrait of a cast of almighty bureaucrats. Though the novel is more than thirty years old, a reader can find shocking similarity with the modern Russia, which is no longer under the iron curtain and no longer governed by communists, but is still playing with dangerous ideas and making same crucial mistakes time after time. I should add that the novel is very well written, its style is rich and its plot is intriguing. It is impossible to close the book once began reading. I would suggest this book to everybody who wants to learn more about Russia and its mysterious soul, but also I would suggest this book to my Russian friends, because forgetting history is making it repeating.\n",
      "textContent--->Can anyone please translate? Hello! Can anyone please tell how the following concepts concerning education are called in English? 1. First of all, lectures and seminars at universities - how are they called together? Classes, like in school, or is there another word? 2. People from the same class in school are called classmates, and people from the same group at university? 3. After our third year at university we (my [classmates] and me) went to SAO - Special Astronomical Observatory situated near Caucasian mountains (and not far from my hometown ^^). Russia's largest telescope is situated there. We went there to see how the things we learned for three years at the university actually work, try doing something ourselves and so on. If I translate the Russian word used for this, it will be \"practice\", but when I asked a friend from Canada, he said that it's better to say \"job training\", but the latter is used when speaking about jobs. I'm not really sure, but can it be applied to my case? As far as I understand, studying at a university can't be called a \"job\"... 4. And the last one. When you are writing your yearly essay or diploma, there's a professor who is helping and guiding you. In Russian he's called \"научный руководитель\", that can be translated as, err... something like \"scientific... instructor\"? How do I say all that in English so that it sounds like something a native speaker would say? Thanks for all the answers in advance, and, as always, I'll appreciate it if you correct all the mistakes in the text above. It was a challenge to write it ^^\"\n",
      "textContent--->Important things of a job It's  not only money which person earns. The first aspect is that it makes you feel better whereas you simply doing your work. You receive a pleasure and that's all. I know a few people who have a poorly-paid job, for instance school teachers. They keep their desire to work so even if they don't obtain enough money, because of the love to children. The second thing is that you go to work due to your strong motives to improve your skills through practice, increase your knowledge and thus develop yourself as a personality. The third aspect is that you obtain sense of respect and recognition. And that is very significant for us. To conclude,  I'd say that job can attract not only through salary, but through possibilities to gain another targets(purposes, which one is better(or may be: aims, gains, objectives)) as well.\n",

Teenagers like to listen to music,dance, play musical instruments. Music plays a very important role in our life, it reflects mood and emotions. Many young people are fond of folk music, modern music. Pop and rock music is also popular among young people. My joy is organ, rock and classical music.\n",

Desert is 90 per cent of Libya. In spite of this artists uses all bright colors for describing their motherland. It was really interesting for me because until recently contemporary art of Libya had been inaccessible to the international community In one hall visitors could saw the antique art of Libya and in other hall - the contemporary art. I’ve added one picture. Artist Saif Al Islam M. Al Qadhafi (How are they remember so long name? :) The title is « the Sun of the Oasis». In real life colors are more vivid then on this picture.

      "textContent--->Trainspotting. To watch something with Scottish accent I was recomended to watch \"Trainspotting\". I have very contrary impression from this film. The film is full of horrible and disgusting scenes, vulgar and repulsive parts, all this drug stuff. But it's impossible to stop watching it. I think this film must be showed to all teens to explain them what \"get into bad company meaned\". I was really impressed with the part where main character refuse frome drugs, remove to London, start to work, but then his friends come and everything roll down again. Soundtrack is great, actors' play is briliant, topic is very sharp. But film isn't about drugs, it's about choice. For me the main idea was if you overcome yourself and will work hard you'll be able toget on train to the better life. It's shoved very clear how all characters bring their lifes to the last line. So the moral is - choose life. P. S. The quote about consumer society is great. P. P. S. Сlose-cut and skinny Ewan McGregor looks gorgeous. But his character is unattractive anyway.\n",

      "textContent--->I've been to Syprus. Today I went back from Syprus. It was amazing and boring at the same time. Amazing because I've known quite different culture. Boring because I've travelled with my father only. Spend your holiday without any people of your age is boring enough. But when I was sitting in a plane I was tried to calm myself that I could meet somebody like me and spend time together. Alas, I was mistaken. The place where we arrived was just a backwoods. There weren't any teenagers like me, only families with small children. Ok, I tried to calm down myself again. One really good news was that the beach was public. I thought my calls were heared by God..... No. Every day one group of Germans played volleyball, I asked to common with them and they agreed. There were two teenagers: girl-Billy and boy-Louise. Everything went OK, before Billy asked where I'm come from. When I said Russia, Billy had a normal reaction, but Louise has started to behave strange. He didn't notice me any more, it was unpleasently for me, so I wasn't very sad when they left the hotel. I still can’t understand why he did that. Unlikely, it was  because   I’m Russian. Perhaps he just didn’t like me and that’s all. On the other side it got more boring after their county. Every day you go on the beach like on work. Ordinary sunbathing and swimming bore you at first few days and you need something new. I decided to try a diving. My instructor was friendly  , he always kidding and smiling me. I’m new in diving, so our immersion was no far of the beach. It was fantastic, despite that  all view was grey and there weren’t such a big diversity of  colours like in Egypt or Austrelia. But I enjoyed every second. I had liked it so much that decided to go again. So, first half of my holydays was flatly, but few last days were more interesting than previous.\n",

It may come as a suprise for you,but nowadays there is some kind of new subculture in Russia,aka Vanilla girls,haha. The example of member of this movement is a girl,who likes rain,coffee,smoking cigarettes,looking out of the window,thinking about HIM and wearing I love (NY,LONDON,PARIS)t-shirts. Personally,I think these girls are ridiculuous and their attitude to life is too childish,It is so stupid to copy someone's style!So,returning to England,I can say it is a nice country with excellent traditions.

      "textContent--->please, help me with the translation it happened so: \"By the end of January 1999 russian unemployment rate reached a record high 12,4 per cent of economically active population size. In December Russian State Committee for Statistics had evaluated unemployed rate in country at the rate of about 11,8 percent of amount of human resources (amount of labor force). In January overall rate of jobless, who was looking for work soever (through advertising, friends, labor exchange) and who was ready to begin work, to amount to 8 million 956 thousand in Russia. For all showings, this being the situation of young employment has more negative apperrances, then being the situation of whole population in the country. The percentage of young people among jobless overrides in one and a half time the amount of youngs among employed people. School-leavers, graduating students from colleges, secondary and high universites to amount to about a quarter (23,8 percent) of jobless youngs at the age of 16-29. The problem of job placement for unnecessary graduatings must be solved. But more reasonable is to try to minimize the inflow of them in the crowds of jobless. Lets consider the problem by example high school. The liquidation of assising college graduates to jobs led to changing all system of relationship between students, institutes, business and state. Some \"vacuum of responsibility\" was appeared. Employment for graduatings don't belong to functions of placement service untill they get unemployment status. Employment for graduatings don't belong to functions of institutes (universites).\" Correct my horrible mistakes, pleeeeease:)\n",

      "textContent--->Art I love reading books. Not only that, but any art: painting, cinema, music etc. I myself try to write tales and it seems to me that sometimes I do it quite well. Actually, I devour much art almost every day, I watch films, read books, listen to the music, watch pictures and write on my own. I can say there are two main interests in my life, spiritual practice and art. In the modern world most of people people don’t give consideration to art. Sure, there are TV-show and pop-music, but most of people know nothing about anything else. I’m not sure that it all happens just now and didn’t happen before, but if you look at old books which were published in USSR you’ll find that numbers of copies were huge. Some numbers of copies came up to 250 000. If you look at books which were published now, you’ll find that their numbers of copies are just a few thousands. What’s the reason? I’m not really sure. Can in be television? I suppose, it certainly can. The thing is television is a very simple thing to watch and it’s simple to become addicted to it. I know that most of people who are over 30 spend almost all their float if front of a TV set. They come from work and the first thing they do is turning a television on. The present generation prefers other things to do, but they are as simple and provoke dependence just like TV. I’m not being preachy, I just think it’s quite a valuable thing to think about. P. S. In last posts I’ve been trying to make many mistakes:) Sure, it’s not an end in itself, I just try to do what I can’t do and learn something new from it.\n",

If I had had all the possibilities to learn a foreign language I have today my English wough have been perfect. - lol I have been learning English since my school years but I can't say I have a natural command of it. The reason is, at least as I see it, that I lack communication. Though I spend much time on reading, writing and listening, I feel I have a want of real, live speaking. There is an opportunity to speak in the Internet but I don't believe in its value. I am not sure I can enrich my English by talking to a person whom I don't know and about topics that I don't care.

      "textContent--->Srinagar and Mountain Road February, 2010. Our point of destination was Gulmarg, the little village thirteen kilometers - six point two miles – from the Pakistan border, but before was Srinagar. We were landing into snow and rain. In the airport there was no police, only military. Our cell phones didn't work because a cellular network was allowed only for locals by authority of military. It was the separatist region contended by Pakistan. On the parking lot there were mix of water and snow around cheap off-road vehicles with chains over worn tires. TATA is a dominant auto brand and severe low-cost. Local guys kept our stuff on a rack really quick. They wore sneakers or rubber boots, loose overalls made with sacking; hat was not at everyone. It was still wet snow fall. We got on the vehicle and went through a city. Houses around were rough construction, some of them were tumbledown. There were a lot of trash around, dust and slush; almost everyone wore a sacking loose overall. Many military motorcades were coming in the opposite direction; every truck had a couple machine gunners on the top. Our TATA, knocking the chains upon puddle snow, went high and high in the mountings. The rain gave way to the heavy snowfall, really heavy snowfall. The serpentine road went through steep descents overgrown with pine forest; massive trees slowly disappear from our views behind the wall of snowfall.\n",

Yoga is very popular now so there are a lot of yoga classes and it's hard to find a teacher who will be good for you. My previous yoga teacher has been teaching me for about 4 years. In the beginning I liked her style very much. I noticed a progress in my practice and everything was going well. Then I became very tired of her and practice didn't bring me pleasure anymore. Fortunately or not, a couple of months ago the club was closed. Now I attend another club not far from home. It's very convenient because it takes me only 5 minutes to get there on foot. I was very lucky to find a good yoga teacher here! He's a very positive guy and I feel myself so relaxed after the practice.

      "textContent--->Odessa The day when we arrived to Odessa was cool but sunny. The City day was celebrated this day and we decided to watch the performance instead of walking along the streets. Next day decided to make a “cane” trip of a tram #20 that ends in the Hadzhibeevskiy estuary. There are two tram on the route and both of them look more threadbare than those in the center of the city. The trip has its name because the old line passes straight through the canes and thickets. Therefore there is a feeling of a trip through the jungle. At the estuary were many fishermen. Next day - the city. The place that you must visit is the Deribasivskaya street. For a short time here you can see the most common types of the townspeople, unless, of course, to try to distinguish them from the many tourists. Having seen enough on the parties, it is possible to take a break. If you walk through Deribasovskaya street to the City garden, take a look at the Cafe Klarabara - there is an amazing meat. No matter what kind of meat is: chicken, pork, beef, veal or lamb. The main thing is that it will be juicy and flavorful. If you want to taste the rich fruit shake, then go to the Greek restaurant “Papa Kosto” that is on the Greek street. Stroll through the Teschin bridge that connects the Primorskiy and Komsomolskiy boulevards and stretches along the Black Sea. This is a place of pilgrimage not only for tourists but also, perhaps, for all married couples of the city. In the evening you can stand on the 192-th step of the Potemkin stairs, which, according to the guidebook, is included in the top five ladders in Europe. Go down and get to the marina and a port which is bright in the afternoon and soft-lighted in the evening. Another \"trip\" is a walk along the coast, through beaches and park alleys. Do not miss a case to ask the direction of passersby, who will necessarily fall on the road: everyone necessarily will show the road and, perhaps, will tell something interesting \"for Odessa.\" Go down to the water through the old streets, but do it slowly, looking at the colorful interior of the courtyards, where there will wait at least five well-fed cats; go into the entrances,  keep an eye to detail, and you will discover a beautiful, cinematic, dilapidated and vintage Odessa.

As can be seen, the high income and average income groups preferred hamburgers, which underwent a sharp popularity increase from under 100 gr to 550 over 20 years. The first group spent on hamburgers over a half of the fast-food-money, that is, about 43 pence, while the second paid out 34 pence. The most popular in 1970 (300 gr) and the least consumable in 1990 (220 gr), was fish and chips, the expenditure on which among high and low incomers was equal. Both groups spent nearly one fifth of a pound weekly. Although in 1990 the British ate 200 gr more pizzas than in 1970; pizza was least buyable within all income groups. Overall, fast foods became more popular, especially hamburgers, which were preferred mostly by high and average incomers.\n",
      "textContent--->How to speak about yourself? I have two questions: 1. Can I call the person whom I will love someday, I will not able to live without him, I want him to be my husband – my future half or second half, or my half, or my close person? 2. Could you check my translation? I adore to travelling, seeing other people, their customs, to get acquainted with their culture, going sightseeing. I like different kind of music, I like music with rhythm you can dance to. And in my spare time I dance. Creative constituent – that is attractive for me. I self-express in dance. According as mood, emotional state or what I want to reach (to be relaxed, sprightly, to get high mood) – I dance to certain music. To my weaknesses I can relate a self-criticism. There are situations when I don’t reach my purpose (aim). And this influences me, I clearly feel my own failures. I don’t like it and in the future I will not commit the same mistakes. Some of my acquaintances relate my maximalism to my drawbacks. Although not all think so because they are the same people who aim at winning and do not recognize failures. I think that on the one hand this trait helps, and on the other hand  it limits. That’s why I am trying to not so critical relating to myself and to receive as much benefit from my failures as I can. I try to manage myself. We all have unique traits to our personality. When these traits are suppressed or unrealized, problems will arise. So, that’s why study (examination) yourself is so important (relevant, significant). I try to search the true reason of difficulties and problems and destroy it. I have a strong belief (conviction) – do manage yourself (work over yourself) in order to develop your  positive qualities and destroy negative ones.\n",

It has Chinese name, too: 雜氣克王  没有壞人 (hope I didn't make mistakes here). Its genre is alternative history.

      "textContent--->Another attempt to master a business news slang When one uses a lot of professional slang and makes familiar words sound weird, we call it \"a bird language\" in Russian. To my taste, business news are written in a bird language. I suspect, the slang here is preferable over the normal language for the targeting reason -- these news are addressed to those who understand this slang. Any slang distinguish \"us\" from \"them\". So, I'm trying to master the business news slang. Here is the news translated by me: The largest Russian handset retailer Euroset published the preliminary non-GAAP diluted quarterly report for the first quarter 2010. Euroset reported 1Q2010 sales in units up 27.6% year on year that amounted to 2.36 mln. Euroset’s sales in Rubles increased by 8.7% and amounted to 13.8 bl Rubles. “The significant retail price decrease for Nokia hurt our revenue,” Euroset’s CEO Alexander Malis said. Nokia’s market share in Russia is about 40%-42%. During the first quarter, large retail chains initiated the price war and drop retail prices for Nokia down that resulted in loss of margin. Euroset’s IPO is expected in 2011. The retailer’s market share is 34% in Russia. Your help is highly appreciated :) \n",
      "textContent--->The film summary \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" The film shows us a story of a young man, who had received the invitations to the weddings one after another. Every time he is late and every time he played jokes on the groom and bride. On the first wedding he met a pretty woman with whom he fell in love, but he didn’t want to admit it. When the wedding was over, his friend and he went home but suddenly he changed his mind and went to the hotel where young lady stayed. He found her hiding between chairs from one man. Then she asked him to follow her. They slept together and then we saw another scene. There was another wedding, and young boy didn’t change his habits. Again he met a young woman but unfortunately she wasn’t alone. She introduced her fiancé to the boy. When they have gone a boy felt a disappointment as he understood that he lose his happiness. The third wedding was, as we can understand, a wedding of this woman and her fiancé. It was an unusual one, based on the Scottish traditions. During the speech of fiancée an accident had happened. The best friend of the main character died. After the wedding, there was a funeral. The young man had a conversation with his best friend, in which they discussed the sense of weddings. The young boy understood that he lost his sweetheart so he had some doubts about marriage. after a few month of this talking we saw another scene. The forth marriage was the marriage of this boy. He married a girl who loved him and they went out for some time but he understood that he didn’t love her as much as it should be. Then he met his sweetheart, who said that she and her husband broke up. The boy was thinking about it. He made the right decision and, with the help of his brother, he ruined the wedding. So he asked this girl to marry him. In the end there were photos which show us that all friends of this boy get married and it proved that everyone should find his own half.\n",

This station are not situated in center of the city, but I very often go to center for walkin on beautiful streets. Many Peterburg's streets save some especial historical form. Little courtyards, narrow streets buildings from 19 century surrounded you and can movie you in this fantastic time. And a lot of cars, shops and coffe houses can't break this illusion. You may walk in this city many days and every day you will open some new details of this atmosphere for youself. Many times I just walk on \"Nevsky prospect\" and go to the Aleksander Nevsky square. Sometimes when i do not hurry i am just turn on right or left in random crossroads and aimlessly walk on little streets feel this unique atmosphere. If you ever will in Saint Petersburg and you will have many time, I advise you just walk on the city one or two hours without any excursions and you will feel this unique atmosphere of 19 centure.\n",

      "textContent--->Contrast paragraph I try to write a contrast paragraph but I'm not sure with punctuation and grammatical. If there are any mistakes, please help. Travelling in your country is different from travelling abroad for many reasons. First of all, when you travel abroad, you usually spend a lot of money. It is more expensive than travelling in your country because you need to pay for air ticket, food and accommodation. In addition, you need to prepare a lot of thing such as passport, visa and winter clothes if you go to cold country. Travelling might take some time but you can have a new experience also. However, when you travel in your country, you don’t need to spend that much. You also don’t need passport or visa. It is comfortable but you might not experience many different things. Both travelling in your country and travelling abroad are good but you should consider your trip carefully if you have a limited money.\n",
      "textContent--->Practice 1 I’m trying practice writing for my exam. Please help me to  check this writing. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays? Music is widespread in many countries. In fact, all the countries have it. Many reasons for people in each country need music. Firstly, people used musical to play for respect god or anything else that they respect; spirits, nature and etc., they thought song will make that satisfy and bless them to happy life. Although, we play it at church now. Next, music can influence people to enjoy and have energy, therefore musicians played it in events, festivals and parties. Finally, some music can relieve stress, so it is brought to heal and knows as music therapy, which can hear in hospital, school or home. In the other hand, music can divide in 2 parts; traditional music and international music. Traditional music is identify country music that people can know where are songs from. Unlike, international music is music that accepts all over the world. Some countries, traditional music is less play in present than the past and difficult to hear. In conclusions, we need music to play for respect Jesus, enjoy in events and therapy. In addition, we should to keep traditional music before it will lose because it is important due to it is identity in each country more than international music that can hear in many country. Thank you.\n",

      "textContent--->Traffic problem in Bangkok (revised) Traffic problem in Bangkok \tThe increasing number of cars on the roads of Bangkok each day has a very significant impact on the life of the residents. What will happen assuming that in the future everyone has a car? \tCompared to the past car buying is very simple today. Car Company uses a variety of techniques to persuade customers to buy a car. With attractive promotions such as free first-class insurance, payment by installments with 0% interest for the first three years including free options and a specified warranty. It becomes obvious that everyone can afford to have a car of their own. \tEven though Bangkok now has Sky train Subway and Bus Rapid Service (BRT), the mass transports systems are mostly under construction and still do not cover the ultimate areas. This unfortunate situation causes the number of cars on the roads to increase continuously and, as everyone is aware, the traffic congestion during the prime time in Bangkok is still unsolved. Another aspect of importance is the fact that many motorists have ignored the duty to oblige to the traffic laws. I think the government should give priority to solving the existing traffic problem by formulating new policies with potential. In summary a policy should be created whereby people are encouraged to commute by forming car pools or using public transport as alternatives to facilitate their travelling, thus reducing the number of cars on the roads.\n",

He let her travel to European country for broaden her view, while she only though about going back to London home. Western man needed Eastern girl to stay alone and have space with him.

I'll share with you about experience of finding money when I was young. When I was in elementary education, toy guns were very popular among boys, so I decided to start my first business by selling plastic bullet. I started to collect bullets from the ground, wash and packed them into a match box. Then I went to sell them among my friends at school, the price is ten pills per bath. The business didn't go well, but I still earned some money. A few days later, one of my friends came and showed me a plastic bag of numerous bullets. He said it costed him just five bath to buy at a shop, which is very very cheaper than mine. I awared that he knew the source, so I decided to close my business instantly. Even though it wasn't successful, but it's always sweet when I think about. There are a few methods that I used to find money but write them all here would be too long. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is my preparation for the next quiz on Friday. My teacher didn't tell the specific topic, so I have to guess it  Please correct for me, Deep thanks ^^   \n",
      "textContent--->leave of absence  Yesterday my colleage has been asked me about one word \"ใบลา\" I try to find the English again then no one in my office know how to use it. I kept this question in my mind until today. One of my senior help me to find the appropiate word for this. It is leave of absence, when I learn the new idiom or compound word, my colleage also told me that many Americans used AWOL to this situation, too. I just reconized this word after long time ago when I spoke it in my primary school English class, I was absence in that day. When I was young I also learn chinese language, unfortunately I could not reconize much now. My chinese teacher always provide us daily homework, Monday is chinease character writting, Tuesday is sentence composition from given word. The big Friday or long vacation we have to write an assay to send for our teacher on Monday. Monthy our teacher will pick up the best writing to show other student how better it was. My way of learning the new word is trying to writing that word in the sentence and remember preposition\" of, in, with.. How English use this preposition, do you use common sence or have a rule? Our preposition \"ที่\" \"ซึ่ง\" \"อัน\" also doesn't use any rule we learn it form listening so we know which one should be used in each sentense. I empower my friend who learn Thai use a lot these preposition, and you will learn from it.\n",

      "textContent--->Appreciate or love Last week I have one feeling in my emotion, appreciate? or love?... this two words seem different to my mind. I have never known its meaning, love?, once I had been asked from someone about love emotion. It looks doubt to me. Because I don't think that I can love anyone more than myself. People who is single will develope his own way of life to love himself, this feeling can give us security to spend lonely life. while appreciate sounds less emotion than love, I often conclude my feeling to everything in my life to appriciate status more than love status. Can somebody explain this two feeling in other meaning? I thought that appreciate could not change somebody habits but love can did it.

A single pet owner, the pet will has a strong bonding with the owner. In contrary to family, pet doesn't seek for their private place,  even female cat get pregnant she always walks back home with kitten.

What can I do to make him want to quit smoking by himself??? Make him think that it's his own idea??? I'm not success, I found only tiredness. Next time.. I hope I'll meet a good boy who enough and right to me. Don't care bad boy, girls.\n",

      "textContent--->Chapter 1 - Tragedy (III) Before I could do anything, I felt that something sharp piercing at my neck and at the same time, I felt the coldness of the knife pierced at my stomach. Then I heard the crack from my neck followed by the man’s growling. “WHAT DID YOU DO, Cynthia?” I fell onto the ground and pretended that I was dead. \t“Her existence will bring great danger to our kind.” I knew that it must be the woman with black hair who said this because her voice was different from the blonde or I could say it was different from any other voice I had ever heard. Her voice was like the charm which can seduce everyone till I didn’t know whether it was her voice which seduced me to believe that I would put the great danger to them or it was my intention from the first sight of the blood on their clothes which I knew exactly that it once belonged to my family. \t“How could a girl like her possibly do any harm to us, Gypsy?” The grey-eyed man groaned. \t“All I know is that her life must be taken.” said the black hair woman. And before the grey-eyed man could say anything, she said, “Or may be you want me to tell Adrian what’s going on here. Is that what you want or will you just burn this damn house and get out with no harm done.”  \t“Come on, Derek. There are lots of girls like this out there.” One of the twins said but I didn’t know whether it was Keith or Kenneth. \t“Fine, what else can I do? She’s dead. And Cynthia, if you dare threat me again, prepare yourself for the consequences.”   \t“I apologize, my lord. It won’t happen again.” \t“Good.” \t“What will we do with the twins?” This time I didn’t really know who was speaking because I was feeling like my body was burning and it was about to explore in a minute. I wanted to stand up, ran, scream or do anything to stop the pain but I couldn’t. I know that there was a chance that I could save my sisters’ lives. \t“Leave them here and burn the house. You’ve already killed my appetite. I’m out of here” Someone (who I assumed that it was Derek) said. “As you wish, my lord. Keith, second floor’s yours. I’ll burn this floor.” I still didn’t know who said this but I knew only that he was having so much fun with it. I didn’t know how long it had passed till I saw the fire was everywhere. I grabbed my head and turned it to the right direction. My clothes and the carpet on the floor were strained with my blood but my wound was no longer bleeding. I got up trembly as I still felt that every inches of my body was burning. I grabbed Amelia and Anita’s hands and went to the dinning room where my mum had told me before I reached here that the party was set there. I just hoped that someone might have survived. When I reached, what I saw make me want to scream on and on till there was no sound left in my throat but what I could do was pressing my teeth at my hand as hard as I could till I tasted my own blood. My mum was lying lifeless on the dinning table, her eyes wide opened. There were at least 3 wounds at her neck, the wounds which were not bleeding anymore. Her skin was so pale like there was no blood left in her body. My brother was there at the corner of the room, lifeless with eyes wide opened and several wounds at the neck as my mum. At first, I didn’t see my dad’s face because he faced down on the floor with one hand that reached to my mum’s direction. I kneed next to him and turned him over with hope that he may has survived but again it was just a hope I already knew that it would never become true. I kissed my dad at his forehead for the last time and took my sisters out at the back door as fast as I could as the fire had reached us.\n",

So, I feel the crisis that I have to review it now or I won't be able to fulfill my dream of speaking English fluently in the future. So please help me studying English.

But it's true. The elephants is a wonderful creature and very very kind (not when it has gone mad but that rarely happens.) The sad thing about elephants in Thailand is that there's some people who bring elephant to the city and asked people's charity to  feed them by buying food from the owner. Instead of living in the forest where they belong, they were dragged to the city and sometimes got hit by a car. Another problem is I don't know how to deal with  that when I found one. If I don't buy the food, I'm afraid that the elephant will be hungry and if I buy it, this thing will never stop. What do you think?\n",

Listening in the class is very important,it helps to understand and conclusion the lesson to be better. Do your homework will have succeed when you take a test. Because teacher usually make the examination from that. Yet another characteristic of a good student is  self-discipline. A student must be on time in the class. also obedient to his teacher. which  to study fun and relax. If a student  possesses all these qualities,then student will have a successful study.\n",

Today, I’d like to tell some history and information to you. Songkran Festival are during 13th and 15th April in every year. April is the hottest month in Thai, and water is the best thing to relieve hot. So this festival came from this. Moreover, Thai belived in ancestor thankfulness. We beg for our ancestor’s bless. Everytime we want moral support, we beg for our parents and ancestor’s bless. Watering our parents is a way to show your thankfulness. So, we use water to be as a representative of good thing (ศิริมงคล). The first day of Songkran is called ‘MaHaSongKran day (วันมหาสงกรานต์)’. This day is Thai New Year, so we usually make merit. Almost village have a place to meet and make merit together. In Thai, almost every village have at least one temple. We have many way to make merit. ^^ Starts from giving foods to monks, then praying, and then watering the image of Buddha. After praying, the president of all monks give ‘holy water (น้ำมนต์)’ to every body. Many people who used to come to Thailand may know that. ^^ http://www.thanapol.com/moowaanza/newhome/KOM_1770.jpg After the ceremony at the temple (or the village), we come back home to water our senior relatives. Since the afternoon until the evening, children go to play water. There are many places depend on each person interesting. As many know, if you are in Bangkok, you must go to KhaoSarn Road (ถนนข้าวสาร). If you are in Southern part, you must go Phuket. If you are in middle part (but not in Bangkok), you must go to NakornSriAyuthaya (นครศรีอยุธยา). If you are in North, ChiangMai is the most famous place. And if you are in North East, there are many provinces and each province has their unique ceremony. The next day, 14th April, is also named in Thai. But I think it’s quite difficult, and not many people know. I believe that some Thai people don’t know… haha So don’t mention it ^^” I just want to say that after we make merit on the first day of festival, we usually go somewhere to rest or travel. It’s depend on each family. Almost family go travelling together. In order to support family activities, the government named the festival as ‘Family festival(วันครอบครัว) /Older person festival(วันผู้สูงอายุ)’  This festival takes 3 days off, so it almost the work days (5 days per week,right?). Many people asked for absence to have a long vacation. Use only 2 days absence but get about 9 days off !! Anyway, the government support that in order to make family warmer and to boost our economy too! For me, this time, I haven’t have a plan to go watering anywhere ^^”. I have only one plan to make merit and water my senior relatives. Anyway, it’s long vacation. I may plan day by day … eiei And something I have to not forget is BOSS2 on this Thursday night… haha…  I hope that I can make you imagine this festival easier. If not, come to our smile Thailand >__< And let me know if anyone need help when you are here ^^ PS... How can I show images during my writing?\n",

      "textContent--->Terrible Internship Experience Last month, I began my internship as a third year undergraduate with one of the most famous English tutorial schools in Thailand. During my interview, the atmosphere was so stressful and competitive. The interviewers ask us [18 interviewees including me] to come up with an idea of a new product and the marketing strategy to make it outstanding. It was like I was going to be a marketer!!!! I was really surprised but not nervous because I takes International Business Management at the university. There had been 2 interviews before I got the internship program. Unlike what I expected, I am not here to learn any single skill or talent useful for future career life but to use the skills I already possess. It is unbelievable that such a famous English tutorial school, with more than 60 branches and 30,000 students nationwide, would have only 4-5 academic officers to make the course. Guess what? All of them gave me their jobs to complete. Moreover, the new employees who had just come to work only 2 weeks told me to finish his work of 19 page translation within 2 weeks. And to compose 17 English vocabulary poems for SAT course. I was and still be infuriated with the way they treat internship student. I got only 100 Baht per day, which is about 3 dollars a day! The only thing which holds me here is the extra money that the academic executive told me she would give. That's all I have for my entry this week. Thanks a bunch if you are willing to correct it for me!\n",

      "textContent--->The first week  of work on 4 July 2011. It was fun to work in the same place that I have done before. It was nice to get to know the new colleagues there too, even if they were a lot of groups in there. First day, I started to work only one Thai teacher greeted me. And the second day, when I was in the office and wanted to talk with teacher who teach on Friday. Another question shot me again \"were you a new TT?\" I said I wasn't because I've worked here and returned again. Then two of them 'Wai' at me. That a shame that they were listening while I was talking with another. It seemed like Thai proverb-anybody can hear by door and window. And first Friday, it was a test of students that they need to listen the conversations. There was some speaking test too. Some of them have done very well. I thought one of colleauge that I talked these day really like me in the past like a mirror refect what I still said 3 years ago about the job we did. One thing is about good treat if it is enough, it would be okay. But it is still so on and on. Even if the world changes, the human never change.\n",

      "textContent--->This Tree of Liberty Thomas Jefferson once said \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants,\" yet I saw a ton of blood watering this tree for decades and nothing but tyrants  rise. Here, in Thailand, there were so many uprising of freemen against the conspired caste system which rooted deep and firm in this country since the very long time ago. When the fight ends, we, citizens, always lie to ourselves that the genuine democracy is at hand and there will be no more innocent's blood to be spilled, no more  life to be taken, no more scream to be heard, and no more gun to be fired at the mass fleshes moving on the road, calling for their rights. Why it is always the blood of democracy-hunger that must pile all over the places, why not those tyrants'? Why the cold-blood murders who slaughter people like animals can get away without any taint? Or  in this country, people like us worth no more than the bullets our taxes paid? This country can go on without us, the working class who just want to have our own leader? To whom ever concerned, I think its time to revise your plan! You cannot even live without us BUT we can live without you!\n",

I been heard and throught about love from my experiences for my whole life. Sometimes good... sometimes bad. It depends on what you think about it but everytimes we must learn from it day by day. Time could help you to heal when you get pain from love and also could bring love to you in a moment. People always scared to get into love because they don't know that love will be last very long or just a moment to end up with pain but I never be afraid to take that risk. Love is too beautiful to be scared of. We only have one life, why have to make it that difficult. For me, if one day I have to die, I will die but my love still with someone that I loved. Positive love always makes you're happy no matter what people did to you. Stay happy and appreciate for what you have. It's the best way for life. Life is too short to be unhappy. Take it or leave it. You know the answer. :)\n",

      "textContent--->A problem of Thailand. Thailand’s problems in term of Thai people we have different point of view. Nowadays most Thais are more concerning about politics economics educations social religion but how many of them focus on pollution of the environment? I believe this problem not only affect Thais but also other people around the world in long term. \tMy experience aboard provide a wider perspective on this problem. In many parts of the world, people are becoming more worried about  the danger of pollution and its effect on the environment . For instance Korean are trending bring their own shopping bags when go to supermarket otherwise they have to pay for it. Japanese offers discount to a customer who not use a plastic bag. Australian usually ask “Do you need a bag?” in order to save the amount of consuming plastic bags,  Whereas  Thais who bring their own shopping bags are very rare to find. Moreover, the cashier also gives too many plastic bags. \tAs we known, plastic is produced by chemical processes and can be formed into shapes when heated. There are many different types of plastic some of them are not biodegradable, unable to decay naturally, the amount of harmful chemicals are releasing into the atmosphere and their effect the environment. I think Thai people should take a serious action on this matter.\n",
      "textContent--->About my birthday. わたしの誕生日！！＾＾ Twenty two years ago, I was one-day-old. That’s right. Yesterday was my birthday!! To tell the truth, I’d never found anything special in this day before. It’s not like I hate it or something, but it’s just another normal day for me. I used to have a lot of birthday parties with my friends during my middle school days. It was fun and those memories are irreplaceable. But those were not enough to change my attitude towards the true meaning of “birthday”. It’s still just a normal day for me. Just another day that happened to exist only once a year. However, I always think that “birthday” is a very special day of one person. The person who most people would never think of when it comes to their birthday. Their mother……. “Your birthday is the day your mother suffered one of the greatest pain in her life.”  This quote was my father’s and I always remembered it since I was a kid. So, every year, after the party, I never forgot to wish for my mom and hugged her with all the good feeling I had. And this year also…….. Yesterday, after I finished my work, I hurried back home without slacking off. On the way home, I bought a cute tiny cake which was topped with cream in heart shaped and carefully carried it all the way home. I bought it from a bakery shop on the train station which means I need to carefully hold it while fighting with the crowds to barge my way in the train. (Believe me, in Thailand it’s also like that ^ ^) I felt like if I were to died on the train, it didn’t really matter as long as this cake was safely delivered to my mom with a postcard that said “I love you, mom” (ผมรักคุณแม่ครับ) Yesterday I received a lot of wishes from my friends and I even got a birthday present from my co-workers. I was very happy about these even so there’s no more party like my old days anymore. But the happiest moment I had yesterday was not on when I received sincerely wishes from my friends or that cute little pink colored teddy bear from my co-workers. It was the smile of the dearest woman in my life, my mom, that made me felt like my life is still worthy….\n",

It's called Stone massage, it's quite good except the stone was kind of too hot for me but it was good to try anyway.

      "textContent--->Adult sport competition \tYou may wonder what I mean by writing ‘adult sport competition’. Is it a sport created only for adults? No, there’s nothing relevant to sport at all. It’s what Thai children today call  the discord which recently (too often) happened. Thai people separated themselves into colors ‘yellow shirt’, ‘red shirt’ and blue shirt. The yellow shirt that supported the present government and had shut down Suwannabhum airport to get what they wanted which was the resignation of  the previous prime minister ‘Samak’ who they think was a Taksin’s puppet. The red shirt people who supported the previous Prime Minister Taksin claim that the present government is corrupt. And the blue shirt people who was against the red shirt. \tWhat the hell is all this? I understand that they did what they think was right but why can’t they realize that there’s on end for this discord if on one stop. When yellow shirt people got what they wanted, the red shirt would not accept it and then again created a mob to protest it. And if the red shirt people got what they wanted, the yellow would not just sit there and do nothing (I used the word ‘if’ because the red shirt didn’t succeed) Right now, everything seems to be normal but I really don’t know that how long it will be like this. Lots of people asked me what color I am. Red or Yellow or blue. My answer was I’m not in any side. My blood is red. My skin is yellow. And oh, I really love blue sky.\n",

Overcome with emotion, I shed a single tear on a silver tray. Throughout your absence, I've been immensely bored and I haven't had anything to do. I once more began again my Sunday strolls with Mr. Utterson, painted some Faberge eggs; cut labels for the canned sweets, and re-read my \"Where's Wally?\" books - although it lacked the same excitement the second time after I’d highlighted Wally with a fuchsia crayon… Now that the litany of my days has been broken, my eyes light up knowing that you’ll restart the chores in the house. Perhaps what is missing are sanded, painted walls, repaired damp patches and a replacement for the cracked glass in the central skylight - but this station in any way is a desolate wasteland! Or perhaps you know of a more creative, original place than this in the world? There are those who declare there was a similar one in Persia, but they lie. I love this place; it is - was, and always will be - my favourite site on the net. Please continue to keep us updated with your work, and remember I will always love you and support you. Although to do that, I'd have to dodge the bullets of my detractors. The train scene was difficult; I know MacGyver would have done it better. Peace to everyone.\n",

When I was young I used to live in a farm and loved when it was raining cats and dogs. I used to sing a song with my sister. It was something like, “Que llueve, que llueve, la virgen de la cueva, los pajaritos cantan…” I wonder if there is a children’s song for the rain in English. I woke up this morning and it was still raining. I like the smell of this morning. It is a damp odor. When it rains very hard, the day has a smooth sadness within, and I enjoy it. I talk about the poetic side of the rain, but of course I am aware that the rain is not always poetic. I mean, many people suffer because of the rain. I am talking about farmers whom crops are ruined because of the rain. But at the same time, I think that their crops can grow (/are possible) because of the rain. Also many people lost their homes because of the flooding caused by the rain. I guess that everything in this world has to be balanced. Neither too many nor very few is good.\n",

That's why I'm travelling to the States this year... when Dec arrives. I think It'll be the 13th like at 7 o' clock.

Last week, I did two English exams. In the first one, we had to write a summary of a given text. In the second one, we had to answer a reading comprehension and we also had to write a composition. When I finished the second exam, I realized something: not only haven’t I learnt anything this year, but I’m also losing my capacity of expression. I’m really disappointed with my career. I have six subjects, but I only learn something in two of them. What’s more, my English and my Spanish are worse than before. I’m planning to read a lot and to watch films in English. I’d prefer to go to Ireland or Great Britain, though. If I go there, I think my English would improve. The problem is that I have to get my driving license and I have to go to my village. I’d be free from the 15th July to the 29th July. If I get my driving license, I’d be free from the 1st September to the 17th September. Does anyone know anywhere where I could study/work?

When I was going to the university, it was raining really hard, and I got a headache. I solve the exam really fast, and then I went home, to slept. The last Thursday I had to inscribe me to the courses of this semester.

Some times, because of being at work, you could not assit and looses exams, just a little problem, with a big impact on your life. I started this week to study, I feel condifent I will have a nice semester. A good news is that a coworker lend me a book about kanji... all written in japanese.

I have to come up with a clever plan to change these habits. Last year, I used to go swimming, do athletics or play tennis. My friends made fun of me because I always got hurt (It was either my leg or my arm and so on and so forth). But this year, I became a real couch potato. I'm considering going on a diet and buying new equipment like a new indoor bicycle and all that sort of stuff. Without taking notice of the things I already have, I'll buy new things to motivate me. I wish it was easy to begin practicing a new sport. It always hurts your muscles and it's very daunting and tough at first. Tomorrow morning I'll get up early and go out to run. Aside from that, I'll lift weights in the afternoon. I was told that drinking lot of water is very important because if you lose one percent of water during the exercise, your performance decreases 10 percent, so I need to drink water before, during and after exercising. I found a marvelous website , www. bodyrock. tv (from then on I became a bodyrocker as she says), where you can learn tips and find fitness advice or workout videos. I've learned a lot from Zuzana. She knows a lot: I tip my hat to her. You should check out her videos on Youtube because they're strikingly good. Every time I watch her videos I learn something. I really appreciate her exhaustive efforts to make us more healthy. My goal is to raise the bar each day (with this I mean I'll improve every day, make sense?), and at the end of 2011 I'll be able to do the same workouts that I did in 2009. As I get used to the workouts I have to eat only low-calorie food like fish. Of course lots of water, and no soft drinks or alcohol. Which is quite easy because I never liked them to begin with.\n",

I remember when I was a child, my teacher, my friends and I were reading a book and we didn’t understand the meaning of both in the sentence ‘Scarcely had the lion and the tigers arrived in the lake when both animals died of thirst’. Miss Carolina, what is the meaning of both? Said my friends and me. My teacher said to us that both are referring to the tigers and the lions together. It is funnier that a person talks you about something and you listen to her/him than to read a book with a small writing without pictures.\n",

For serveral years, some friends of mine, whom are very well versed on comic books, suggest me to read Watchmen. Now Im sorry i did not follow their advise. If the comic is half as good as the movie I should have read it long before. The deep, and humanity of the characters is unlikely of the stereotipical comic book heroes. The history treats several interesting themes as, human nature, perceived reality, politics and the line betwen ideologis and the real world. The movie is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where vigilantes like Batman are real and once, even sponsored by the goverment, but then outlawed by Nixon who in his third period on the oval office.(WTF!) The world is a brink of nuclear war, and a famous vigilante, the Comedian was killed, setting a great and coplex history in movement. My favorite character is Rorschach, a detective like vigilante whose mask changes on black and white ink dots patterns. He is very skillful and cunning, also a badass who delivers justice to criminals with great violence. I took my mother to see this movie with me. She says she enjoy it, but I think it was a little hard to understant for her.\n",

The problems for choose the type of goverment in America started later of the Revolutionary War; when instead of a colony; America was a new young country. There were opinions trying to decide if a Strong federal goverment would be better or a weak central goverment. However, there was a lot of war veterans who preferred a strong central goverment; in that way can became a powerful political force and have back pay from goverment for their efforts on war. Also, some soldiers wanted a strong federal goverment because they believed than they could save their money to theirselves.\n",

In my community code-mixing(Spanglish) is a very common practice. I use it very often with my friends and family, but I never use it for academic or professional purposes. I think is cool to have a different way to communicate. I never used Spanglish in Mexico. I know is not as important as Standard English, but I learned to use because I wanted to be able to understand my classmates and friends, basically because I wanted to feel a sense of belonging. Anyways, my main goal is to learn Standard English, but I would also like to be able to understand different dialects. What do you think?\n",

El viaje no duró mucho, porque lo hice en avión y eso fue bastante cómodo. Lo único fue que tuve que hacer noche en Aeroparque (aeropuerto de cabotaje de Buenos Aires)... pero el piso estaba cómodo y pude tomar y comer ahí ^^ Pase de estar en un lugar con 38ºC de máxima a uno con 8ºC o menos de temperatura máxima. Lo bueno es que me gusta el frío y el invierno (aunque sea en verano). ------------ After finishing my university year in the City of Mendoza (Argentina), I had to travel 3000 kms south, to the city of Río Gallegos (also in Argentina). The trip didn't take long, because I did it by plane and that was pretty confortable.

      "textContent--->China's pollution Today, I saw a documentary about China's pollution. In my opinion, there is a lot of pollution over there because the handwork is too cheaper. Most of the companies from overseas put their factory over there. I have an Iphone which it says that is designed in United States and assembled in China. This is obviously that in China the handwork is very cheaper than United States. Also, There are a lot of Chinese people. The country is over polluted. What I have learned in History is that Chinese people were always dominated by another region so their culture is different in different parts of China. The government should do something to reduce the pollution over there.\n",

There are things I don't understand when I listen the song and some other things I don't really know if I am undertanding them right or if it's just my brain. So, I've tried to write down the parts that I do understand and, if you could help me a little bit with some verses or even just a sentence or a word I would appreciate it very much <3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiX4WZb7utg I figure that you're OK living your life the way that you thought that it should be  easier and free you thought that it should be. From the bus to the train sleeping out in the rain you don't need anything at all, anything at all, anything at all. You left the city and said that you liked how we held each other highly in regard gently in our arms highly in regard When I came out to you ¿-? Did we want anything at all, anything at all, anything at all? Anything at all, you said: “Please, don't write those love songs just for me. Life's gonna fly right before our eyes So now is the time for living free.” Now I've tried to forget all the straps on your dress how they wrapped around you tightly wrapped around you tightly wrapped around you tighter than my arms ever could when we danced on the hardwood you whispered in my ear, whispered all your fears and I told you: “dear, anything at all, that you need all you would have to say is: please. Life is gonna fly right before our eyes so, now is the time that we can be.” An unexpected moment I still laugh, when I recall that crooked smile you turned when we danced. So, you keep your heart I would just need a part of it. anything at all, anything at all, anything at all. You could call late at night if you needed something right away anything at all, anything at all. anything at all, I just need to hear you whisper: please. Life's gonna fly right before our eyes So, right now can we be? Can we be anything all? 'Cuz I just need to hear you whisper: please, life's gonna fly right before our eyes so, right now can we be? Thank you very much!\n",

      "textContent--->From the TV perspective Two and a half men is a very popular tv show, my parents watch it like... almost everyday haha, they have been watching the show for about a year or so, I never knew it was such a global phenomenon until now that the big news that the show´s been canceled is all over the place, heck I just watched a movie called Due Date (or something) and that show is featured in it. I like Two and a half men, sometimes I watch it and it does make me laugh, but like most american shows I´ve enjoyed, I don´t ever really get hooked to them, not like japanese anime shows, which are more like mexican soap operas+kung fu with one big story arch that encompases ten or twenty episodes, I wonder which formula is actually more evil hahaha, I´ve been watching anime since I was like 4, and I would always get so hooked to their stories and characters. Now, I used to be a hardcore gamer (now I´m casual... that´s what they all say I know), and I also wonder why the Japanese never do First Person Shooter videogames or even RTS (real time strategy) games, and why Americans rarely do RPG games, well actually they make them more frequently now but it´s usually in the form of a First Person Shooter/RTS game! haha. Anyways there´s a point to this haha, pretty much, I notice that the japanese tend to have more solid ideals or methods that reject change while americans tend to be more flexible with their philosophies, I mean that´s kind of what I´ve been noticing, and at least those differences show a lot in their pop culture. Of course the USA is a melting pot of cultures while Japan is pretty much unicultural. In Mexico, I think people from the south are a little bit more like the Japanese, more formal, more traditional, they probably even have a more powerful sense of pride in being Mexican(or whatever they are/do), while in the North we are more informal, we speak kinda rude sometimes, yell a lot more, we speak our mind more, we expect others to speak their minds, we rarely wear suits in our jobs, haha etc. Of course when you travel you learn things might not be as stereotipical but I assume that as time goes by, and the world becomes a more global society, new, maybe more organic forms of behavior will develope. I might not know much about the world yet but, I´m pretty sure thats already happening.\n",

The second reason is because my new school is on sixteen blocks from my house. It's the nearest school. And the supermaket is about 10 blocks over here. So I will walk because I have to walk. I didn't walk since one year. I always went out to take a walk because I lived near from a park. The botanical park was in front of my house. But now I live in another city and the park is near from my house. It is ten blocks from here. (over here?) . I was searching on Internet and I found the benefits of take a walk. They are many. * It helps to control the weight. * Improvement the blood circulation. * Avoids the cardiacs problems. * Helps to the digestion. * Acts like a hungry suppressor * Maintains the bones healthy and strong, helping to straighten them. * Eliminates tensions and concerns. * Prevent breathing problems. * Deletes the fat. * Tonify the thighs, calf and hip muscles. * Improvement the peripheral vision. * Increases the level of endorphins. The endorphins are the natural soothing produced by the body. * Promotes the system immunity. * Helps to grow up. Well, with those benefits of course I will walk more. I want to grow up!!

The \"jamón serrano\" is the leg of the pig. They must be cured with salt , the temperatue and humidity is important too. The salt will go inside , and they only have to take the just enough and at the same time the water will go away from the meat. The way you cut it ,is important too. And it´s the best if you cut it just when you want to eat it. Nobody can resist to a good plate of \"jamón serrano\"!! Do you want to try it?\n",

I think Argentina will win the cup. As Maradona said: “We have Messi”. In this moment Messi is the best football player in the world. He is very fast; and when he is running, it looks like the ball was attached to his foot. Some people say that Ronaldo or Rooney are the best, but they are already out of the competition. However I am worried about Argentina next match. Germany team showed a good game against England team. Argentina vs Germany is the best game in the next stage of the World Cup. Despite this, I am sure Argentina will obtain its third cup.\n",
      "textContent--->Translation: Charles Darwin Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who postulated that all living species have evolved over time from a common antecessor through a process called natural selection. Born in Shrewsbury, on February 12th 1809, Darwin was the fifth son of a well-off English family. After studying medicine in Edinburgh for two years, he entered Cambridge to study theology. One of his professors, the botanist Dr. Henslow, made him regain his interest in natural sciences, and especially in geology, botany and entomology. With his recommendation, he embarked on the Beagle as the naturalist of the expedition of Captain Fitzroy in 1831. For five years they traveled across South America and the Pacific islands and the young Darwin was gathering observations upon which he would base all his later investigations. In 1871 he published the book “The descent of man”, where he defended the theory that the evolution of men started from an animal similar to the monkey. Religious authorities called him atheist and blasphemous. ******* Charles Darwin fue un naturalista inglés que postuló que todas las especies de seres vivos han evolucionado con el tiempo a partir de un antepasado común mediante un proceso denominado selección natural.

When people look at you they know that you know what are you doing, your advices always will be heard and you will be an example for other people. At the work, a shiny day is waiting for you. Everything will look like magic act because you'll solve all your problems as if them were the easiest things in the world. You will find solutions for the hardest problems, and you'll act with wisdom just in the right time. At the love, your relationship will get better..... (seriously, my horoscope says aweful things about love I don't want to write. It's embarrased) At the health, you have a dose of pessimism. This dose don't make you feel better. Be more positive because this dose is hurting you.\n",
      "textContent--->Hi everybody !!! Let me introduce myself, my name is David. I from Mexico. So from where I will start..... OK.... I left to study english 5 years ago, so I think, I forgot a lot of words and expresions, then I found lang-8 site and I though \"Why not, let´s continue learning english and let's get corrections from my writings\" Yesteday I when to the cinema to watch the \"Bounty Hunter\" movie (in spanish \"El caza recompensas\") with Jeniffer Aniston and Gerard Butler. The movie wasn't the one I was thinking because I though, it was a comedy???!!!!, but not, all the movie is aromantic show with some little bit comedy episodies. I recommend it for the guys that have a breaking down relationship and don't understand why they can't be together but can't be separate also (sniff, sniff, sniff) Today, I didn't have my Japanese class because of the \"Semana Santa\", I have been studiying for 3 months and I hope in a some few months I can have a full Japanese conversation (I think....) And tomorrow morning, I will go for my mother that was on vacation all the week...... and...... I think I will be resting and cleaning my room all the sunday (maybe watching a rented video movie, I don't which one) and then..... start working from the monday again, since 6 o'clock in the morning. Ok, that's all.... Thanks for your comments and corrections. Best Regards\n",

Thank you.\n",
      "textContent--->My hometown I believe that my hometown, Puerto de Sagunto, is a boring place if you are a teenager and you live there in winter. But  despite of this, it is the best place to stay in summer. Puerto de Sagunto is a seaside town where people have a good time doing many things. For example, dancing, swimming, doing sports, going to concerts…  As for nightlife, I think that there are not too many places to go, only two or three discos. It seems to me that it happens because people prefer to drink near the beach paying a cheaper alcohol. Furthermore, in winter it is quite cold so you can’t go to swim. To sum up, it’s a beautiful place or a boring place, depending on the issue.\n",
      "textContent--->One question!! When you write something talking about you, for example: I go to beach next summer, and I will go to eat a paella. Always say \"I\" my question is: when you write \"I\" always must be like this \"I\" and no like this \"i\"?? I hope you understand me!!\n",
      "textContent--->Waiting for you Waiting him is what she hates the most. 10.35 pm  He’s not at home yet. A soft whimper breaks the silence. She looks again the old clock. 11.05 pm “Where are you?” 11.30 pm The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him. The living-room is cold, so is she. 11.55 pm “Where are you?” Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over. “I’m waiting for you… where are you?” 12.15 am She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen. Breaking news: A young man dies in a horrible car accident. The culprit was driving under the influence of drugs and he hit the young man that was waiting for the last bus…. The sound of keys makes her jump and run though the corridor. She needs to reach the main door, she needs to know that he’s fine… alive. Breathless, she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and she’s unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe. $“Hey, what’s wrong, babe?” the boy asks softy, he’s tired because of work. “Nothing, you’re here, that’s the only thing I need right now” Smiling, the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy “It’s late, you should be sleeping, no waiting for me” he says tenderly “You know I won’t be sleeping until you’ll be here” Narrowing his eyes, the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on. “Go to our room, I’ll turn off the TV and the lights”  In silence, he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen. A man’s bloody body lies on the road and next to him; a young woman cries her lungs out while two policemen try to avoid her to look at the cadaver. Feeling goosebumps he turns off the TV and goes to their room. There, he holds her tight making her smile. “Now you’re here I can sleep” For the first time in five years, he understands why she’s always waiting for him to come back home.\n",

      "textContent--->Addition When I am on my way to the university in the bus, I like to talk up about any issue in English. This is just for keeping my practice. Today I tried to talk about math, but I realized that I didn’t now how to talk properly about math in English. For that reason, when I came home, I decided to look for some math lessons for kids on the Internet. When you are learning a language you are like a kid in all the way, I mean you must learn again everything you have learned until now in a different language. So, I dived right in math. I studied some beginning addition lessons using sets in order to explain how it works. A neat way to teach kids how addition works is like this: get a yardstick and something to mark it, it could be a rock or a minute stick. For doing, for example, 5+6, place the mark at the position of the yardstick with the number 5, and then move up 6 places (since it is plus 6). Your final position should be at 11. So, 5+6=11. Isn’t easy?\n",

In January I was thinking that this year was going to be the worst of my life, for some personal reasons. But in the next months, all my life changed, now I am living in a new town, Toledo. It isn't like Madrid, and I love Madrid, but it is a beautiful old city, so quiet and comfortable to live, and I can go to Madrid whenever I want becouse it's so close to it. I have a new job, and I like so much. I've meet a lot of new amazing people and live a lot of good moments with them. And I have so many projects for 2010, trips with friends, interesting cosplay groups, a new degree on Maths... Then, I think this has been a very good year, and I hope next it's going to be better. Happy new year!\n",

      "textContent--->Three Spanish speaking movies HI. This text is a little long, so you don't have to read it all or correct it all. If you want to correct one or two lines, it would be great. Thanks in advance. Today I saw two different films. One in the movies, and the other in my computer. I usually do not like going to the movies, because I consider it very expensive and I cannot do anything else in the movies, but to watch the film, so I have the feeling I am losing precious time. While in my house, it is free, and I can do homework, study English and Korean, reply emails, etc. Those are the main reasons why I do not go that often to the theatre. However today my mother paid the tickets, and I end up going to Cinepolis. There were different interesting and commercial pictures, which I can easily download anytime. So I chose a movie that was not that common, so my going to the movies would be worth it. I picked \"La casa muda\" (Silent House). I do not regret my election, despite the fact of being crappy from almost any angle, because it was something different. It was filmed in Uruguay and is based on real events. The movie was filmed using just one camera and in real time, that is quite an achievement. Although the story and the results of the one-camera-real-time experiment were not that good. In other words, I would say this movie sucked not hard, but sucked anyway. However, I read in some forums that people were claiming Uruguayan film industry was improving because of this picture. Given its low quality and insignificant funding, I find this fact as astonishing. The plot, if you can call it that way, was about a girl, his father and the owner of a country house. The former two go to the house to repair it, so the it can be rented or sold, I do not know. There are some interesting things revealed at the end and the abnormal events happening in the house (well, the abnormal event that happen in that night). Second movie. I remember a few months ago, following the explained logic, I picked \"El Camino de las Flores\" (The Road of Flowers). This was a Mexican product which took place in the Northern state of Baja California (however the actors talked with an obvious Mexico-city accent). The main idea was OK, but there were so many incoherences. This was a normal movie in terms of the filming (many cameras, good sound, different angles, etc.), and I remember there was a strong marketing campaign for this movie, I naively thought \"if Mexicans don't do horror movies that often, at least the few ones that come out must be good, see the campaign! It must be good\" I was wrong. This movie totally sucked, and I felt pretty bad because I was expecting something better given the enthusiastically made mock-ups in Cinepolis. It was very predictable, the ending was completely off, and there were many unexplained things. I wish I could say something better about this movie, but I cannot. Third movie. After coming back from the theatre, I searched information about Silent House, and I ran into \"Los Ojos de Julia\" (Julia's eyes) in a forum. A Spanish movie from the directors of the Orfanato (Foster House?), I decided to watch it. This was a very good movie. I am not saying OMG this THE movie, but it was pretty good, specially when compared to the other two. The story was fine, maybe a little predictable in the last quarter of the movie, the acting was amazing and the overall quality of the movie (don't know the word, maybe the image or fotography) was on pair with US American movies. After watching these three films, all Spanish speaking ones, I wondered why countries which do not produce horror movies that often, or which do not have a big film industry (Mexico and Uruguay) come up with these sucky movies. In the case of Uruguay, I guessed the director did not have much funds, but if you are going to film something so bad, better not to film anything. In the case of Mexico, this was not the first recent horror movie, KM31 was not amazing, but was way better than El Camino de las Flores. So if the film industry does not have much funding or official support, why are they still making pretty bad movies? It is supposed to be the contrary, when there are not so many opportunities around, you are supposed to be the best and do the best so you can guarantee future funding. Maybe the special effects will not be that great, and the acting, not the best given the financial restrictions, but the story can and must be good and interesting. Mexico is full of superstitious people and crazy legends, you can get good stories if you look for them. The Spaniards have been doing great (or OK) horror or suspense movies: Thesis, REC, Foster House/el Orfanato, Backbone's Devil/El Espinazo del Diablo, which is also a coproduction with Mexico, and now Julia's Eyes. Like the director of The Foster House, if you make interesting and good movies, then you will get more funds for the next one. I praise that Mexicans (I cannot talk about Uruguay since Silent House should not be even considered a professional movie) are making incursions in different genres, instead of sticking to the boring and predictable romance movie, but if you are going to use scarce resources, then do something good!\n",

      "textContent--->[ING 003] On time and Technologie On time and Technologie It has been very evident for all us that new inventions have brought us a lot of advantages. Among the wide range of items that make part of this century and that are considered to be part of the human mind’s most incredible creations, it is possible to find trains, computers (in all their ways: Ipods, Pcs, mp3 players, etc ) and a thousand other things. All those elements are the result of centuries of work in which human being has tried to fight against the things that have made his life more difficult. As an example, trains were created in order to eliminate space and time obstacles between people. Let’s imagine for a moment the classic scene of the two lovers who have to separate from each other having to wait a long time not only to see each other again but also for receiving news from his/her beloved. Traditional communication ways as mail post took (and still take) too much time to bring a message that sometimes can save lifes. Horses have been replaced by planes as well as ships. All those are inventions with the power to send a flower from Australia to Finland or a Cd from South Africa to Canada. More than the 50% of the population now is able to dream of traveling to a foreign land far away from his original continent. This dream is also nourished by the thousand of images and videos watched everyday from every coin of the world. Despite of the fact that I can spend even days talking about the advantages of nowadays technologie, today I want to talk about the negative part that still exists when using it. Fifteen years ago I hardly know that the best computer application was DOS. Today my room is “decorated” with a printer and a laptop that is connected to a home theater in which I can listen to a Hi quality disc. Ten years ago I knew that somewhere on the net I would find the answer to most of the questions I had just by introducing the letters www. google. com and spending about ten minutes searching for the answer. Eventhough human being adapts to everything, in this case adaptation has turned to be an exagerated search of take advantage of time. Nowadays, we get extremely stressed when google takes more than 5 seconds to show a result and we get even more stressed if we have to retype the words again because we didn’t write it properly. We feel worry if a message we are waiting for doesn’t arrive immediately and we start to reload and reload hundreds of times our mail inbox page. The worst thing has arrived with facebook, where thousands of people are sticked to the screen during hours just to wait that someone “likes” his last (from the thousands a day) comment. I have tried to show that internet has changed our lifes in a positive as well as in a negative way. In the other hand, does everybody try to use internet to take advantage of time or rather to use the rest of the time on it? Social networks have become social networks instead of being virtual social networks! Teenagers read (useful things) less than before and spent more time in front of the screen instead of feeling how a walk can make them feel better. I realized that I become addicted to Lang-8. But it is only an addiction that tries to calm down my anxiety for learning languages. In addition, I also discovered that my time conception depends on my stressing environment. It is up to me to change this. And there is a lot to talk about concerning this topic. Life has given me a warning that I want to follow. I am thinking about a new way of leaning which I will tell in my newer posts. Thanks for reading, correcting and commenting. What is your conception of time??\n",

Turn it in at the office. No questions will be asked. I really need it\" Or like it: \"If you found my wallet, please return it. You can take all my money, only I need my school identification\" Or worse: \"I ask reward for return my cell phone. It's urgent. I'm Roberto, group 505.\" What does it mean? Does it mean that Roberto wants money and his cell phone? He's crazy. But not all ads are stupids. There are many informative ads pasted by the administration.\n",

      "textContent--->letter of motivation Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Patricia M. Vera S., I am 26 years old, Venezuelan citizen and I obtained my degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 2007 as a Chemical Engineer. I speak and write English and I am currently studying French. Through your Web site and other specialized publications, I was been able to obtain valuable information about the Specialized Master in Gas Engineering and Management you offer in your vast portfolio of graduate courses and masters’ degrees. I'm really interested for the mentioned program, because I want to extend my academic credentials in the area of gas, area in which I did various projects during my studies in chemical engineering. I would like to start The Master’s Degree in Gas Engineering and Management the next academic period that starts in September-2010. Worldwide one of the sectors that is booming is the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gaseous fuels. For that reasons I think this would give me a strong background as a chemical engineer in this area, as well as forming the technological development by applying in the industry knowledge efficiently and successfully, and taking leadership positions in major sectors of engineering. What makes this special to me are the 2-stage Master which includes the acquisition of skills learned through courses taught by gas industry experts and situation scenarios and the second one is putting those skills into practice and developing them through a 4-month internship abroad. In the other hand, the offer of GDF SUEZ for recruiting a young engineers and offer to finance €14,000, including their Master’s Degree year and the payment an allowance for their internship period in one of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries, to defray educational costs and at the end of the program, the young graduates join GDF SUEZ for a minimum of 4 years, starting in a technical management or team management job within the Research and Innovation Department, or a subsidiary of the Infrastructures Division. I believe that I have the right profile to be accepted by the GDF SUEZ and initiate studies with them in September of this year, I am willing to travel wherever you need at anytime. I enclose herewith my resume and I remain at your disposal to provide more information, thanking the attention given to this letter, Yours sincerely\n",
      "textContent--->Brief introduction in English Hello everyone! If you are reading this I'm more than thankful for that. I haven't really been studying English but as I'm living in a English speaking country I came to learn it naturally. Of course I'm not saying I'm a native speaker, I'm far far away from that. I'm afraid my mother tongue which is Spanish influences my English a lot. I've found myself several times trying to say something the way I'd do it in Spanish, and as those languages are quite similar each other sometimes I trust too much in that deed trying to say a word I don't know in English using my Spanish vocab with a weird accent because maybe the word is similar in both languages, which sometimes works but most of the times it doesn't. Anyway, I believe that this site will help to train my brain to think the way a native English speaker would think. I've found myself really enjoying learning new languages because I believe languages are not only words or grammatical structures but a way to deliver your mind to people you wouldn't even imagine, and I came to realised that languages contain the culture and I'd go farther and say the heart, the passion and manners of the people. I'd like to encourage the people out there to learn a second and why not a third tongue as it is a great experience.\n",
      "textContent--->A controversial topic The gay marriage Nowadays, People have the right to get married, it is a right for everyone but what do you think about the gay marriage? Firstly, some people same that everyone have the right to be happy and the law is the same for all. For that reason, there should not matter the sexual orientation. Besides, many experts believe that children raised by homosexual couples grow as well as children raised by heterosexual couples. However, religious people think that God only created man and woman to form a family. Also, many people say that the adoptation only be allowed to heterosexual couples because children could be confused in a gay marriage. Personally, I think the gay marriage is not a religious topic and all people have the right to get married without discrimination.\n",
      "textContent--->LEARNING A LANGUAGE My teacher gave me this poem last year when I was starting classes for my next exam. I found it really useful and I think it's motivating and encouraging... LEARNING A LANGUAGE Learning a language is like doing a jigsaw puzzle of a million pieces with a picture that keeps changing. It's like getting lost in a foreign city without a map. It's like playing tennis without a ball, like being an ant in a field of grasshoppers. It's being an acrobat with a broken leg, an actor without a script, a carpenter without a saw, a storyteller without a middle or an end. But then gradually it¹s like being out in the early morning with the mists lifting. It¹s like a chink of light under a door, like finding the glove you were looking for, catching the train you thought you were going to miss, getting an unlooked-for present, exchanging a smile. And then one day it's like riding a bicycle very fast downhill. Olivia McMahon\n",

The wall was gray, the humidity was excesive. I was losing the sense of the time. And I started to hallucinate. Then, my captors opened the door, gave a slice of bread and some water. They told me: 'Get up and come with us' I did that. I was noticing some king of presence in my back, was it a ghost? it was saying me: 'You are the one, we have chosen you for the mission'. My captors bandaged my eyes, I couldn't see anything. They kept me walking for some time, I think I walked through a forest. It was cold. I was almost nude. At some moment I felt like I was walking alone... and I was. I reached a solid soil, clearly I reached a road. I couldn't get rid of the bandage over my eyes, My hands were handcuffed in my back.

      "textContent--->An Autobiography I was born in the early 80's, in an industrial city in the province of Ciudad Real, Spain. I don't have many memories about when i went into the kinder garden, only that I went there 2 years Then I went to the primary school where i made some friends, specially where I met my best friend, in that time we really hate each other, we don't be close until the secondary school. Fortunately or unfortunately.. when we finished the primary school and move to the higschool, the goverment decided to change the Educational System, the level in the classes was so high and i had many problems with my marks. I must recognize in that time i was really bad student. Since i was child i showed much more skills in artistic activities, specially drawing and painting. I decided studied Fine Arts. I moved to another city for study. I lived  in Cuenca for 7 years, the best years of my life i guess.. Some summers when i went back to my hometown since I was 18 year old I worked in a part time job to financing my studies. Two years ago I finished my Fine Arts degree, then i did a Master for teachers. I'm kinda interested to teach, one of the reason that help me to become much more interested was.. the period of practises when I work as teacher, was really cool experience. Last summer I went in an academy in Ireland studying languages with an English Grant, was my first time abroad and one of the best experiences in my life. Currenly I'm keep studying English in a school of languages and i'm preparing my teacher examination in an academy. I'd like to work as teacher of art in Highchool. I hope to be a nice teacher in the future.\n",
      "textContent--->Going back to Sweden (The following is a future entry in my blog, where I explain my Erasmus experience in Sweden. I have decided to begin writing in it also in English in order to improve my writing with the corrections of the beloved community of Lang8 :)) [Note for readers] Hi there! I have decided to start writing down my blog, in which I write about my stay in Sweden, in English. The objective is to improve my English and to give you the opportunity of reading about my insignificant life! My stay in Spain due to the Christmas’ break is finishing tomorrow, and I’m going back to classes in my dear adoptive city: Stockholm. During all the vacation I have been seeing in the forecast how temperatures were softer than when I was there. .. shit! Even these days it has been over 0 degrees, and it seems that my beloved snow (always pretty, though a bit son of a bitch when you are carrying your suitcase) is melting down. Anyway, for all the people who are saying that I’m going to freeze up and blah blah, I go by the facts:  15th December, Madrid = -6º, Stockholm = 0º. Ok, ok, to be fair, the truth is that here in Spain it has been a great weather all Christmas. The only days it got chiller, it was no more that what I call “amateur cold”. For Christ sake, I would send all of you that are complaining with shit like “The street is cold” or “I want to go inside” to the lake near my residence in Sweden, where the poor ducks have been confined to a little spot because of the implacable ice. Anyway, being here these weeks in Christmas (oh fuck, I love to have actual holidays in Christmas) has made that I have became aware of some little things of the life I have missed about my dear homeland all these months. And, of course, some things that suck about being here. All about this in this pretty list of pros and cons: Pro: “Cañas y tapas”. Because there is nothing better in life that taking a cold beer accompanied with a delicious Spanish “tapa”. Con: “Canis” and other suburban tribes, characterized by their IQ, near to Sweden mean temperature. I prefer Swedish people that smooth back their hair with gel and wear big empty glasses. Pro:  To get out and not being scare of death from exposure. In Spain is not necessary to take care of having all your skin covered, with risk of amputation caused by frostbite. Con: Spanish rubbish television: despite I rarely watch television, when the shit hits the fan…Special consideration to the New Year’s Eve program with all the pink press. FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU!! Pro:  To cook far away from the smoke detector. Mhh…well, right. What I really wanted to say was:  Pro: Not cook!! Con:  Everybody saying: “But you must have not been unnoticed there!” Well,  ok, I know I’m blonde with blue eyes, but stop saying that all the times…I’m purely Spanish, you fucking idiots! And, with no more to say…au revoire Spain! See you soon!\n",

      "textContent--->The 8 dumbest car stealers or the 8 most stupid car thiefs 8. Was he committed? Yes. Was he smart? No. Carjacking is the serious crime that consists of taking a vehicle when it is in possession of another person. According to federal law, who commits this crime can receive a sentence up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty. We can say that Tyrone Davis’ problem was not his firm character, but the lack of focus. After all, he had two long weeks robbing two stores, entering a house, assaulting a 41 year old woman that lived there and then stealing her car in December of 2006. We have not even mentioned what brought him to our list. He was trying to escape from the Titusville police and he crashed his Dodge Shadow 1992 against the curb. Then, Davis, with a knife on his hand, tried to steal a Saab that was stopped at an intersection. He could only grab the door handle before the driver stepped on the gas pedal in order to flee. However, the driver drove fast with Davis still hanging from the door handle. Next, in a display of dedication that almost deserves praise if it was not so stupid, David kept on grabbing the door handle for several blocks and at speeds up to 45 miles per hour. In fact, Davis only let the handle go when he was tackled by a police officer.\n",

      "textContent--->A joke? Yesterday, my brother reminded me about a travel to Tenerife that we did five years ago, especially several strange situations that was happened us. The first day I arrived in the island, we sat down in a bar and I ordered a milkshake because I have never liked the coffee. The waiter told me he didn’t had it, so I decided to order a glass of milk. At this moment, the waiter by looking at me like I was a mad man said he didn’t understand what I was ordering because anybody had never ordered it. I was so surprised that I didn’t know what I could tell him. However, my brother explained him that he must only spill milk in a cup or glass. The waiter went into the bar, and a few minutes later he came back with a cup of milk, but it was so hot that I must wait for one hour for drinking it. And we ordered the bill he said the cup of milk was free because he don’t know how money charge for it. The second day, we went to another bar, and I ordered again a milkshake and other waiter said again he didn’t have it. And nor did he know what was a glass of milk. I began to think that was a joke. The next day the situation was replayed again in other bar with other waiter. Then, we began to laugh and the waiter became angry because he thought we were laughing at him.\n",

Ich habe nicht sehr gut geschlafen, weil ich ein paar Male aufgewacht bin. Es war zu warm. Dann habe ich gut gefrühstückt und geduscht und bin weg gegangen. Danach habe einen Freund zum Hafen beglitten, weil er den Schiff um 15.30 nehmen musste. Wir haben uns verabschiden und er ist eingestiegen. Vom Hafen habe ich einen kleinen Spaziergang gemacht bis zu McDonals, wo ich eine Freundin treffen musste. Ich bin mich in einer Buchhandlung und in einem Teehaus gehaltet. Das Teehaus war leider geschloßen, weil heute Sonntaig ist. Um 16.15 habe ich meine Freunde Chris vor McDonals getroffen. Wir essen nie dort, aber es ist ein guter Treffpunkt. Wir möchten zum Park. Dafür mussten wir den Bus nehmen, aber wir haben die falsche Linie genommen und wir mussten aufsteigen und wider auf die richtige  einsteigen. Als wir endlich zum Park angekommen sind, haben wir uns ein bisschen unterhalten. Das Gespräch war sehr angenehm. Dann möchten wir eine heiße Schokolade trinken, aber alles war geschlossen. Als ich zurück nach Hause gekommen bin, habe ich abengegessen. Gestern hatte ich \"pain au chocolat\" gebacken. Sie sind kleine Tasche aus Blätterteig gefüllte mit Schokolade. Die waren meine ersten. Das heiß, das war das erste mal, dass ich sie gebacken habe. Sie waren nicht perfekt aber sie waren gut! Ich habe eine gegessen. Lecker!\n",

      "textContent--->Don´t have words There are more than 5000 languages in the world and none of them is exactly a copy of other. All languages share tons of characteristics; they have verbs, adjectives, adverbs, a subject, pronouns, nouns, etc. But when you compare languages in a deeper level their differences make a huge difference. Languages are close related or not event related because of the language they come from. Ones come from Latin and others from Germanic but even when they come from different languages they share quite a lot of aspects. I personally think they all come from a common language nobody has ever discovered. When somebody wants to learn a language, they use their native tongue in order to learn a second language so they have the basis to build on the structure of a new language. Yet the main problem lies in some aspects languages do not share at all. It may be that one language locates its verbs at the end of the sentence while the other set them at the very beginning of the sentence. Some languages may not have articles and instead they use particles to cover this problem which at the end is not a problem but the way that language works. Culture is close related to languages, because somehow culture is created by culture and culture is built in language. So, the way people think is the way they see the world that surround them through language. No one would see a world if they do not have a language first, due to the lack of previous knowledge. Without the word “table” and the phonetic sound /(tā´bəl)/ this person could never know that this object (the table) is a table itself. He may call it by his own personal way but what he would be doing in that moment is creating a language for himself in order to name things. Concordantly, language is a social aspect the human life, and the agreement of use is something that people should do in order to settle a official language. All the population of certain place should agree that table is “an article of furniture supported by one or more vertical legs and having a flat horizontal surface.”  So everyone could communicate and talk about tables. But we all agree that in this world as, as we told before, there is not only one language and what is a table in English is a “mesa” in Spanish and “テーブル” (teeburu) in Japanese and none of them share even the same words. Then how do these words mean the same but they are written using different characters? The answer is quite simple, language have they own words to name things, as simple as that. If a language would use words from other language to name every of its items, it may use as well use the same grammar and syntax and the result would be two identical languages which will end in a fusion of them and the creating of, not a new language, the same language. That is why languages are so different and with it the way people sees the world. As we said before, language share common characteristics but as they do this, they also have differences not only in their structure but in their vocabulary as well and this creates problems when learning languages. Let’s say we have a word for “dad” in English and we use it just like that, to name the person we grew up with, who teach us what we know and who we consider our father. So we call “dad” that person, using examples such as: my dad, his dad, her dad, etc. But what happens when we want to learn the Japanese word for “dad”? Well, we face the problem that they do not only have one word for “dad” but many. All depending in the social status, the respect and the closeness you have with that person. So here we have the same person who we would call “dad” in England or United States but that in Japan we should call him “ちち” (chichi), “あふ” (afu), “だいふ” (taifu), “ちちおや” (chichioya), “とうさん” (toosan), “おとうさま” (otoosama), “おとうさん” (otoosan), etc. The later aspect does not mean the Japanese have more fathers than we do, but that they have different ways to call him taking in consideration details to name him that way. It can be if he is my father or is the father of my friend, or if it is the father of my new friend. All these characteristics are fully taken in consideration when Japanese people talk but when we do we just skip not because we lack the knowledge to notice them but because in “our world” we do not see this aspects in such a general and important way. Not only we can talk about single items of vocabulary, but let´s imagine we have two people talking about colors, a type of red color to paint one the people´s house. Then one of them says: I want the color red that we see every day when the sunsets. That sentence “the color red that we see every day when the sunsets” could be described in Japanese with only one word but not necessarily using such a long sentence. Why is this? Because Japanese may see this color using one word because in “their world” that color does not reflects the sunset but just a color. Japanese language has no difference between the colors blue and green and it is not that they do not have those two colors because they have them, but it is just that they have one single word to describe both (aoi). Maybe because of the globalization they needed at some point to create a word to make a difference (midori) but it was because of necessity and not self creation that they did. I personally think our language do not lack of word to describe things or have more words to describe things, it is just the way people see the word the way they call things. It is their necessities what makes them create new words or have words to call thing we may not even need. But when we do, we may use a previous created word or just invent one for ourselves.\n",
      "textContent--->SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Scientific researches  are necessary to improve the quality of people's life, but  reserch need to be funded . Some people suggest that Government should carried out the investigations while others think the opposite. I firmily believe that scientific studies shoul be funded by both the Government and private corporation according to the kind of research. On one hand, Governments should be in charge of running basic researches such as  national defense and enviromental issue because these topics have national effect . So, they required national attention. In fact, if Governments do not invest in the development of millitary intelligent strategies, for example, It will be very dangerous for the state, likewise, the environmental issue is of national interest therefore national institutions and universities should carry out studies to tackle this issue. On the other hand,Private Institutions tend to devote to profit oriented researches . They continuously invest money to discover new products . A good example of this are  the drug companies that carried out investigations to find new cures for diseases that effect the most people. These companies benefits individuals with the cure and make profit for themselves. To sum up, Scientific research should have research funding from Goverments and private institutions. They both have specific areas to investigate and their active involvement is the key to the development of the world.\n",

First, It's ecologic that's means that i'm an ecologic girl because I give some help to the planet. Second, because this notebook says my name and my name is pretty weird in my country. I love it. I bought two draw's pencils because my sister is an artist, well she loves to draw anime's characters. She's so good drawing also my brother I am the only one in my family who cant draw well. After the stationery my mom and I went to the chicken's restaurant and we bought chicken for the dinner.

      "textContent--->Courses, courses and more courses. It've been a long time since a wrote my last entry. I've been a bit busy and a bit run out of ideas. During this time I had finished to work as au pair and came back to Spain. I also studied a plumbing course (I am not a very common girl, you can see) and a computing course. I'm usually doing courses and more courses. I love doing it, I'm a very curious woman and I love learning new things. So, I was finishing my job in UK and coming back to Spain. The first thing I did was looking for a new job (with no luck) and then looking for a new course (hehe). Maybe I must start saying that I studied a kind of interior designer in Alicante, which was very interesting but we had very poor technology teaching so I think I need more technology knowledge in plumbing, electricity or building. And that was the reason for me studying plumbing! :D. Plumbing was quite interesting and I wasn't the only girl in the class like I was afraid of. A peruan woman in her fifties also studied with me and it was very encouraging seeing a mother like her studying what she like without worrying about female and male jobs. As well, our classmates were very fairly and didn't judge us and we made a fantastic job in our practice workshop. And the computing course was Macromedia Flash MX and now I know how to make my own gifs, I'm so happy!! Here you are my first gif, it's not a art work but I'm a bit overexcited with it, haha.\n",

      "textContent--->You said you wanna learn Spanish? I am a Spanish speaker from Mexico which is quite important because Mexican people will correct your texts into Spanish talked in Mexico, not Spain. In Spain they´ll say; He terminado el trabajo. In Mexico we say;   Terminé el trabajo. There are ample, ample of diferences between the spanish from Spain and from the one in Mexico. And actually Spain they don´t speak Spanish ( they won´t say that theyspeak Spanish but \"Castellano\".) Nevertheless is the same, Castellano and Spanish are the same. Anyway I am going to write this because of  a simple thing, that most of people that is learning Spanish should know. This is common in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, well all Latin America. (I don´t know in Spain) What is an Adverb? According to the RAE (Real Academia de la lengua Española) an adverb is: Adverbio. (Del lat. adverbĭum). 1. m. Gram. PALABRA INVARIABLE cuya función consiste en complementar la significación del verbo, de un adjetivo, de otro adverbio y de ciertas secuencias. Hay adverbios de lugar, como aquí, delante, lejos; de tiempo, como hoy, mientras, nunca; de modo, como bien, despacio, fácilmente; de cantidad o grado, como bastante, mucho, ....................... http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=adverbio If you don´t get Spanish enough the only part you must get is this one; PALABRA INVARIABLE (Invariable word.) So is a word you CAN¨T  modify (let me laugh! hahahahahahahahhahahahahah) If you have been in Mexico or some country in Latin America, I bet you have hear the word \"ahorita\", and perhaps because of the compound of letters you might know that comes from \"ahora\" (now/ right now) but if you look it  into  the dictionary that word must be between \"ahora\" and \"ahorcar\" (to hang). So is that a word?, yeah!!!!, is that an adverb? Of course it is!!!!!! Is it used in the common language? Are you kidding? Is indispensable to know that word!!! This takes us to other problem (if you want to call it problem) the \"diminutive\" of the words. In English we have a word like \"little\"  that helps us to say that the dog in little, \"Ahh that little dog\". And in Spanish we have the suffixes \"ito\" and \"ita\", so if we want to say that the dog is little  we can say either: el pequeño perro or el perro chiquito/pequeñito. So the diminutive is most common in Latin America, and is most realted with baby stuff and women, (this doesn´t mean that men can say it, you can, just that you must know when you can say it. \"If you want me to make a list when you can and when you can´t, just ask for it\") and these \"ito and \"ita\" sound lovely. But ok, you can modify nouns, and adjetives, but ADVERBS? Yeahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! you can!!!!!! Well at least with \"ahora\" you can!! Ahora=ahorita=Ahorititita!!! You must be asking WTF is that!!!! And you are right, WTF is that? Well the only thing I can say is..... that ahorititita is an adverb. How can I learn words like that in every language, well, perhaps you have either of two options,; go to the country they say that, or get a girlfriend/boyfriend from that country. Why this? Because who uses this kind of words? THE PEOPLE!!!! and only the people, the user of that language, not the textbooks. So get involve into the language enviroment. And remember every language has dialects and every dialect has its own dialects. And like a person in Peru answered to this question once:  ¿Cuántos hijos tiene usted?(how many children do you have? = Tenguito solamentito dositos hijitos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I little have little two little sons.) WTF the verb is modified!!!! You can modify everything but that doesn´t mean it is correct. So if you are learning Spanish you have a long, long road in front of you. Like me, I am learning Japanese and I know that I have a massive road in front of me. Actually Spanish scary  me even when I am native speaker. You don´t realized what you are talking until you start searching into the language, then you will notice that your language is not as easy as the phrase \"la casa es azul\" (the blue house). Don´t give up and keep fighting, and you will get it. So if you have questions about the Spanish language  spoken in Mexico, you can ask me, and I will respond you.\n",
      "textContent--->Dreaming I was dreaming just some hours ago about being in a water riding coaster style park!!! was so much fun. different games between a ride and water plays. I finally got dizzy of so much movement. well and I woke up; Had a great breakfast at subway with my love and I'm back home. I had dreamt before about that park, the new ride was insane! sadly I couldn't find it because I woke up! but I was in the lane just about to get to it. It's funny how dreams can be related and interconnected; mixing reality and a different complete unusual logical interrelations. Sometimes I dreamt and then I realized that I dreamt about it because I saw that on TV or someone talk to me about this other thing and in my dream they appeared  mixed in something fantastic and in a way that I have never thought about it. Well was a fun dream this night!\n",
      "textContent--->Christmas in Colombia In Colombia, we celebrate Christmas on the 24th. The gifts are opened at midnight and every one is hungover for the 25th. Christmas is very different from the way the US celebrates it. My family was very poor and I lived in a small town. My mom was a dress maker. Our tradition is that on the 24th, you were new clothes, go to church and party like crazy. I was the happiest little girl wearing my new outfits. I would also get a new outfit for New Year's Eve and that would be the two only new outfits I would get for the rest of the year. Santa Clause did not gave us presents. That guy was only in movies. We got presents from Baby Jesus. However, my mom used to tell me that since Baby Jesus was so poor and he lived in a stable, he did not have money for a gift that year. It was not important if I did not get a gift because my cousins did so we would play with their toys in the 25th. The 24th was only work for my mother . Many people asked her to make new clothes for that night but they payed her during the next year. Then, my mom used the sewing machine until 11:30pm. At 11:30, she would say \"Feliz Navidad\" to us and hide because she hated to interact with so many people. For the rest of the neighborhood, people would dance, drink and eat the whole night. When it was midnight, everyone would go from house to house to say \"Feliz Navidad\" with a kiss and a hug. Without exaggerating, everyone would kiss and hug at least 40 people from midnight to 1am. The next day, the 25th, was for people to sleep all they wanted and cure their hungover. For that, some families went to the pool or the river and cook grilled meet or make a delicious Sancocho. I am not sure if I miss all that. It was always very intense. However, my Colombians friends will be in a big party tonight while I will be going out for dinner and going to the movies.\n",

      "textContent--->hwk essay Prompt:  It is said that the United States is the land of opportunity, and many immigrants have found it. However, some immigrants have not always been welcomed. They have faced hardships because of discrimination. Write an essay where you narrate an incident where you, or a family relative, or a friend experienced discrimination. Are we all equals before the law? Even though The Constitution of The United States of America clearly states that we are all equals before the law, it seems that this constitutional right it is not completely truth, almost every Latino immigrant have suffered some kind of discrimination by a government agency. In a recent survey most Latino immigrants have reported some cases of discrimination by the police department (local or state) and from the immigration service. Policemen are on the streets to protect us from the criminals, but for most Latinos the police department is a synonym of discrimination. There have been a lot of reports spread by the press of police abuse against immigrants all over the country. The most commons police abuses are: First, arresting Latinos immigrants only for their look, it looks like being a Latino make you a suspect of any crime on the vicinity , and second, arresting them simply because some immigrants do not speak English, and by consequence cannot defend their selves from the accusations. I have not been arrested on my entire life, and have never had a problem with the police in my home country or in the US, but there was this time when a white lady hit me on the road, and despite the police officer saw the whole thing, he did not give the white lady a ticket. He was very gently with her and very rude with me. He even harassed me telling me if I don’t leave the accident scene he will blame me for the accident. I told him that I was going to take the incident to court, and he told me that the judge will believe anything he tells him. And you know what the judge did; he believes the policeman history and gave me a nice fine and a couple of points in my license for reckless driving. I believe the policeman treat me like that because of my Latino accent. I felt so discriminated at that time. Another government institution beside the police departments that is known by its habits in discriminating Latino immigrants is the department of immigration and homeland security. It seems that they think that all the Latinos in the United States are illegal immigrants. One of my friends once told me that he had been arrested for the department of immigration. They took him away from his job and sent him to one of their facility for interrogation, my friend at that time had a green card but he never carry it around because he was afraid of losing it. He finally called his wife, who grabbed his green card from their home and took it to him. He was release and they gave him an apology. He believes that they arrested him only because he did not speak English. Finally, Even though the US constitution makes us equals, some government agencies make Latino immigrants different. It is already hard to leave our countries, came to America to work very hard, learned a new language and adopted a new culture, for some bureaucratic and inefficient institutions making it harder.\n",

It's mostly a very good place where you can enjoy our traditional dishes. It's located in the San Martin 1062 avenue Pueblo Libre. Particularly, they have a great and good variety of food, a big menu of traditional meals and dishes such as papa rellena, ceviche, butifarra and one of the most famous is \"choritos a la chalaca\". The whole place has an structure of our colonial time! i think is one of the only places in the capital city that maintains these traditions. Inside of the restaurant, you will see many pictures about the time when this place was under construction, pictures of our first monorail, the first cars in peru, etc. The place is quite small but very comfortable. The waiters are a bit old but they are really good. I feel very pleasant every time i go there, you can't not only find out about our food, but also you can find out a little bit about our history! and  there are a lot of foreigners going there as well. The price it's quite normal and i find it reasonable since they cook very well.. I would like to recommend this restaurant for all the tourists who are coming to visit Peru, if you plan to fill your stomach with something tradtional, fast, unique and good with such a ancient place like this, don't hesistate and go find it out for your own.\n",
      "textContent--->visiting a castle When I was a child, I used to spend my holidays in my grandmother's village with my parents. I remember a time that we went to a castle near there that is almost abandoned. It is a great stone building that have four tower, one in every corner, and his walls are broad. Around it, there are a small village. When we arrived in this village, my father asked a neighbor who was in the village's square about how we could go up the castle. The old man gave us a huge and  ancien key and told us when we would arrive up, we would open the door with it. Going to the castle was tiring, but was amazing because it was like we had turned to medieval times. While my parents saw it quietly, my brother and I ran up and down by a lot of steps until my brother fell and he did a injury in his knee. At this moment, my father became angry and shouted to us that we must to return at home. Fortunely, I encouraged my father to go to the castle again the next day.\n",
      "textContent--->Conferences During the weekend of March 12-13, 2010, I had a great experience when I attended the 2010 annual conference “Discovering the Power of Language” given by the Foreign Language Association of Georgia (FLAG). There were two talks that I enjoyed very much. First, I was inspired by the talk given by Greg Sanchez, “The Joy of Writing and Singing your own Songs! No Experience Necessary!”. There, I learned that many popular songs use simple musical structures, which I can use to make my own songs. For example, I can create a different version of the song “La bamba”. Mr. Sanchez gave us a PowerPoint with a tool that can play important guitar notes. We can use these important notes to play a song. During this, talk we created lyrics for some popular songs and it was very entertaining. Second, I was impressed with the activities presented by Cynthia Alby and others, “Teaching Vocabulary to Tactile and Kinesthetic Learners”. They explained that many students in our classrooms are tactile/kinesthetic learners, but most vocabulary instructions and review is geared toward visual or auditory learners. During their talk, we experience hands-on vocabulary activities. I remember very vividly how we wrote short words on our partners back using our fingers while our partner had to guess what word it was. The purpose of the activity was to practice the spelling of new vocabulary words. I thought it was a very interesting approach for teaching vocabulary.\n",

      "textContent--->\"TAPAS\" My friends know that I´m spanish and I want to share with you some word we have here:\"Tapas\". If you look at the dictionary the meaning is something that cover the saucepan. But the other meaning we have is more interesting. When people think about Spain they think in different words... maybe: flamenco dance, bullfighter, nap,tapas... but today I want to tell you where it comes from the word \"tapas\". A long time ago when people was going to the bar and asked a wine´s glass , the waiter served the glass cover with a piece of ham. And why that? For the flies. The flies were one of the problems they had and I don´t think they had healthy conditions. Nowadays, we say \"tapas\" ,small portions of distinct dishes or traditional products. They are often taken in midday from noon until dinner time. Tapas were served for free when you asked for an alcoholic drink. Now is not so common to be free, we have to pay if we want they serve. There are a variety of \"tapas\" . You can make \"tapas\" with all types of food. I loved to eat only with \"tapas\" ,it´s the way to eat a lot of different things.\n",

I'm participating in a university contest involving some tests (I don't feel test is the best word... can you think of a better one?), all about the Millenium Objetives stated by the UNO. After each team submits its proposal, there's a week for the people to vote their faouvorite on the web. After that, a jury scores/rates each one, and so the winner for each test is chosen. There's a final prize for the three ones scoring highest at the end of the contest: they all can enrol for free in a postgrade major course (or a language one, if they haven't finished their career). Additionally, the first team get to travel to New York! We won last test, and each of the components of our team got a mobile phone. As I had just bought a Motorola Milestone (the european version of Droid), I gave it to my father, who's actually very happy with it, since it's a cute small nokia with wifi. We go firsts now, but since they try to give one prize to a different team each time, we expect the jury to make the ones who go third win this time. But we still hope we win at last and visit USA!!

For example, spanish for Death Eaters is \"Mortífagos\", or spanish for portkey is \"traslador\".

      "textContent--->Amazed by Juan Rulfo Amazed by Juan Rulfo Gabriel García Márquez The day I discovered Juan Rulfo will be, without any doubts, a main chapter in my memories, as the day I discovered Franz Kafka. I will tell the story. I had arrived to México the same day that Ernest Hemingway killed himself with a gun’s shot, on July 2, 1961; and I have to admit that I hadn’t read Rulfo’s books yet, and what’s more I hadn’t even heard anything about him. I lived in an apartment, without elevator, on Renán Street, in Anzures colony. We had a double matrix on the floor in the main dormitory, a cradle in the other room, and a table in the living room, with only two chairs that were useful for all, where I ate and wrote. I was 32 years old. I had made a brief journalist career in Colombia. I had just stayed three useful and hard years in Paris, and eight months in New York. In that moment, I just wanted to write movie scripts in Mexico. The atmosphere literary in Mexico in those days were very similar to Colombia´s; and I felt great among them. Six years before I had published my first novel, “The Leaf Storm”, and I also had three unpublished books: “No One Writes to the Colonel”, that appeared in that time in Colombia, “In Evil Hour”, that was published by Era Editorial, later by Vicente Rojo; and finally a short stories collection, “Big Mama’s Funeral”. So I was a writer with five underground books, but it was not my real problem, since I hadn’t became a writer in order to become famous, but to be loved by my friends a little more. I thought that I had already achieved that. My big problem as a novelist was that after those books I felt to be in a blind alley. I was looking everywhere how to escape from that. I already knew those good and bad authors that could have teach me something, and, I felt spinning in concentric circles, although. I didn’t consider myself exhausted; on the contrary, I felt that I still had to write many additional books. It was just that I hadn’t found a convenient and poetic way to write them. I was that way, when Álvaro Mutis went upstairs seven floors to my apartment with a box full of books. He looked inside for the smallest one and gave it to me and told me with a smile on his face, “Read this thing, so that you can learn how to write”. It was “Pedro Páramo” by Juan Rulfo. This is a translation. http://www.ciudadseva.com/textos/teoria/opin/ggm6.htm\n",

Lucerna es una típica ciudad suiza, y sus altas murallas y viejas atalayas aumentan su delicioso aspecto vetusto y llaman la atención cuando uno llega a ella a través del hermoso lago. Hay muchos recuerdos interesantes dignos de verse en Lucerna además de los edificios viejos. El León de Lucerna es una espléndida obra de escultura tallada en la roca sólida en 1821 y está dedicada a la memoria de los guardias suizos que murieron en la defensa de las Tullerías de París al comienzo de la Revolución Francesa. La catedral es famosa por su órgano maravilloso, que está considerado como uno de los mejores de Europa. Ginebra, que se ha convertido en un lugar de gran importancia política, es otra famosa ciudad suiza. Las colinas que circundan su bello lago son comparativamente bajas y, aunque alcanzamos a ver los nevados picos del Monte Blanco, las montañas parecen tan oscuras y distantes que casi nos olvidamos de que estamos en Suiza. ******* Even without the magnificent scenery of the mountains, Switzerland would be very quaint.

Lucerne is a typical Swiss city, and its high walls and old watch towers increase its delightful ancient appearance and draw atenttion when you arrive to it through the beautiful lake. There are many interesting memories to see in Lucerne, in addition to the old buildings. The Lion of Lucerne is a splendid sculpture work carved on the solid rock in 1821 and is dedícated to the memory of the Swiss guards who died defending the Tuileries of Paris at the beginning of the French Revolution. The cathedral is famous for its marvelous organ, which is considered one of the best of Europe. Geneva, which has become a place of great politic importance, is another famous Swiss city. The hills that surround its beautiful lake are comparatively low and, although we get to see the snowy peaks of Mount Blanc, the mountains seem so dark and distant that we almost forget we are in Switzerland.\n",

He used to be part of TEAM A, and that`s pretty much what the first half is about, and then he moved and started the new TEAM B. Eisa is a type of okinawan dance were they use taiko drums.>> Greeting Leader's Greeting My first encounter with the Eisa was back in summer of 2003, when I watched a TEAM A Tokyo Chapter performance for the first time. Under the blazing sun, the group performed with such an intensity that overwhelmed me, and from that day onwards I became a regular spectator of their performances. The following year, I was accepted as a member, and along with the everyday practices I had the chance to stand (appear/ perform?) in many different events and festivals. In 2008, I became Sub-Leader and took the responsibility of transferring everything the older members of the team had tough us to the next generation. I hold dear many precious memories of my experience there. From now on, as leader of TEAM B, I strive to making the most out of my experience in TEAM A and taking it to the next level. My goal is to grow (raise?) a group whose performances can move and impress everyone watching. The formation of TEAM B could not have been possible without the support and aid of many people, which I am most thankful to. Also, as regards to the kindness and warmth we receive from the people who come to see our performances we cannot possibly put our appreciation into words, but instead, into every beat of the Taiko drum we hold, and into every step of our dances, with all of our might (we thank you?). <<This last paragraph may need a lot of work, am I using the word perform too much? I cannot find a suitable synonym. Thank you!!!!>>\n",
      "textContent--->The gold girder Today I'm going to tell you about a very interesting story that belongs to the popular literature of my little coutry. You can usually read it in Galician, the Galicia's language, but I'll try to write it in English. In our country, there are a lot of ancient estructures that were built before the roman conquest. Their name is \"castros\", and it's said that they were buit by an ancient culture, probably linked to the celts. But the legend says that under these structures you can find a lot of treasures and marvelous things. There is an only little problem: if you try getting them, you could be buried alive and die in the dephts of earth. The fact is, according to these stories, that there exist tunnels where the girders were made in gold. They are called in Galician language \"Trabes de ouro\". But is very dangerous to try getting the girders. Indeed, according to the popular stories, there are some of them that were made in coal tar, and a mechanism involves them in flames if somebody touch them. I am not trying to frighten you, but, although many people went to looking for these treasures, almost nobody returned alive, and who did it had become crazy.\n",

      "textContent--->Spanish Civil War The Spanish Civil War was a conflict between republicans and nationalists. The rebellion started on July 17, 1936 in Morocco. The day after, the rebellion continued in the Iberian Peninsula. The first objective of nationalists was to take up Madrid and win the war quickly. Nationalists couldn't to take up Madrid because republicans resisted with help of URSS. Then, nationalists tried to cut off Madrid. Nationalists lost the “Batalla del Jarama” and “Batalla de Guadalajara” in 1936. URSS and French helped republicans with International Brigades and tanks called, T-24. Mussolini helped nationalists with tanks called “Fiat Ansaldo”. Hitler too helped nationalists with a terrible troop called Condor Legion. The next objective of nationalists was to take up the north of Spain. The Condor Legion bombed Gernika, and Picasso painted it. Spain was divided in half, so Nationalists began the attack of the Mediterraneo to cut off the republic zone in 1938. Republicans knew that they were losing then they began the battle of the Ebro. Republicans army was massacred and nationalists army could to take up all Catalonia. Republican zone didn't have aliments and the people was hungry. In April of 1939 nationalists won the war and, they took up all Spain without resistence.\n",
      "textContent--->About Extra Textual Analysis Performing extra textual analysis on a text is fundamental in both translation of natural sciences texts and social sciences texts. Extra textual analysis is a powerful and essential tool for fulfilling a fine translation of a given text, since before of translating a text it is necessary to understand it. It can not be said that extra textual analysis is more complex in one type of text than in the other one. In both of the two types of texts is presented a rich amount of extra textual information such as cultural aspects or relationships among the different fields of the science. For example, in the paper, “Salvador Dalí or the Persistence of Memories –True and False”, it is vital to be aware of who Sigmund Freud, André Breton and Federico García Lorca were, besides it is important to posses a knowledge of the Surrealist Movement, since Dalí was one its main members. To understand and then translate this article it is necessary to know about Dalí personality which was always very close to his pieces of work. If you misunderstand what the author are saying, then some mistakes in the translation could appear. In the text, “Cloning Protocol of Aloe Vera as a Study-Case for ‘Tailor-Made’ Biotechnology to Small Farmers”, the translator should be aware of some fields of the biology as biotechnology and cloning. It is not enough to translate what an author says in his text, the translator should be a kind of erudite and know the relationships among the text he is translating and other similar texts.\n",

When I was twelve years old I found a magic book in my grandfather´s library: \"Magia, Ilusionismo y Prestidigitación\" ( I don't translate this words because the three mean the same in english) of Antonio de Armenteras. I read it very quicly. It was fantastic... but I left the hobbie. Some years later, when I was twenty-three years old I recovered the hobbie. I bought one book : \"Cartomagia fundamental\" (Basic magic with cards) of Vicente Canuto and I bought some decks to practice. Today I have a lot of books of magic, over thirty. I am a good magician and I enjoy when people enjoy watching my performances. If sometime you are in Sevilla and you want to enjoy, contact with me. We can have one or two beers while I am acting for you. Thank you for read and correct.\n",

      "textContent--->Parties My social life is not that exciting. I usually stay home during the weekends and during the week I study very hard. However, next Friday (November 5th) I was invited by two people to their houses. The first person was a friend from school who already graduated. She invited me to stay at her house and drink with some other ex classmates. It sounded very fun so I say that it was very likely that I would be there. However, a German friend is leaving for a couple of months and she just sent me an e-mail inviting me to her farewell party. I would really like to go to both places but they are very far so I have to cancel one. I will go to the farewell party because I feel bad not going. Sadly, I will have to cancel my girl's nigh out with my school friends. Hopefully, we will be able to party together again. I just wish this two events were not in the same day.\n",

      "textContent--->Hello everyone! First entry in Lang-8 Hi there! My name is Esteban and I'm writing here for the very first time... I was dragged here by Tofugu this certain guy who vloggs and gives away resources to those who are self-teaching themselves Japanese online. Textfugu, is his website. Good that I knew him so I can give it a try to this Lang-8 thing. I am also fond of Japan and Korea but at the time I am not studying these languages although I expect to start studying them soon. In the mean time I'll write over here to perfect my English. Actually \"perfect\" is a word too heavy to carry around. I'll say then that I want to learn more and more! :D  It's been aproximately 4 years since I formally started studying English but I almost never have the chance to be corrected when I practice either because my friends are too kind to me or because I don't usually write letters or any document in English or beacause I am not understood. :( I want to write over here every now and then and become more confident in my writing. Also I really enjoy practicing and sharing stuff in this my second language. I look forward to being corrected and to have my most common mistakes pointed out. I think I can take that as long as you don't go too hard on me. I thank you all in advance and I hope to know more about you over here. I am at your disposition if you ever need a native Spanish speaker. I'm from Mexico BTW but since I study literature (esp. playwriting) I think I can be very useful if ever required by you no matter which spanish you are learning. My spelling is one little problem I have and that is one thing I believe is important for me to be advised in. Since I've been learning from teachers who thaught both American and British English the outcome of my writing might be a strange strange mixture them. I want to be consistent with BrE since the last two years I've been learning under a British-like system, but well, that's too much to say in a firts entry. I know it might be difficult to explain to me every error y might do... so I thank you again if you can comment me. Oh boy am I nervous!! O_O :) Thanks a bunch! Esteban\n",
      "textContent--->Translation: Portugal Portugal is situated on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula; it borders Spain to the north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south. The two largest cities in Portugal are Lisbon and Porto. Although Lisbon is the official capital and the center of southern Portugal, Porto is considered by the people of the north as the most important city. The situation of Lisbon is splendid, built as it is, for the most part, on high ground on the banks of the Tagus. Porto, further north, also enjoys a splendid situation. It stands on the steep banks of the Douro River, between which two high bridges have been built. ******* Portugal está situado sobre la costa occidental de la Península Ibérica; limita con España por el norte y el este; y con el Océano Atlántico por el oeste y el sur. Las dos ciudades mayores de Portugal son Lisboa y Oporto. Aunque Lisboa es la capital oficial y el centro del sur de Portugal, Oporto es considerada por los habitantes del norte como la ciudad más importante. La situación de Lisboa es espléndida, construida como está, en su mayor parte, en un terreno elevado a orillas del Tajo. Oporto, más al norte, disfruta también de una situación espléndida. Se levanta sobre las escarpadas orillas del Río Duero, entre las cuales se han tendido dos puentes elevados.\n",

      "textContent--->Trials help us to overcome In my opinion, the trials is always in our life but is very importand learn to overcome and deal. First, a lot of people has many problems in their life. For example, if you have a litle problem in your work or in your family you have to find the solution but if you can´t do it alone, perhaps you could talk to someone like your friend or family member to help you find a solution or give you some good advice. Second,This life is very important to overcome the evidence day by day get in our way helps us overcome them grow and mature as people. For example,If you want to be someone in life you have to go through many obstacles whether personally and in terms of work, if we are to succeed in your life have to be much effort in the end all sacrifice has its rewards. The most important reason is,Die bewyse wat ons in die verlede gehad het en ons help om nie foute in ons lewens te oorkom. In addition,not what we are if we did not learn of our own problems.\n",
      "textContent--->Music in Other Languages I remember those year in high school when I did not know English. I always thought it was cool to be able to understand other languages. I spent hours listening to songs in English, finding their lyrics, translating them, and try to sing them. I thought music was better when it was a challenge. Now, I think music in English or Spanish is OK. However, my interest has shifted towards other languages. Now, I spend hours trying to sing along with Korean and Chinese songs. I can read and pronounce the romanized lyrics but I do not know what I am saying most of the time. I find very funny that what I am looking for is otherness. I think I fall into the trap of exoticizing other languages. Anyway, that is what motivates me to investigate other languages and cultures.\n",

      "textContent--->It´s time to change I had to write this for my english class, I hope you could help me with my writing, Thank you! Its time to change… with this sentence the first thing that comes to my mind is a song from Juanes (the colombian singer). Have you ever hear about this song? I know that is a stupid comparation, but it is a very famous song and always is in the radio. Even if it is a song from Juanes, I think that the context and the meaning of the song have a lot of things that are true. The song said that the people in the world have forgotten the frienship, the love and other good fellings, and now the only thing that is important for us is the money and the work. In all the song he never suggest something to finish with that problem, well, yes he did but it is a very corny solution. In my personal point of view the only way to change it is start with us. If I don´t have the intention to change with little things I can´t change the biggest. Anyway, the sentence Its time to change makes me think in how difficult is try to start something to change. Because we can change many things, like superficial things, like a cellphone, a computer, a dress, etc. We can change habits too, like the sport we practice, the school where we go, or the serie that we watch on tv. But I think that Its time to change it is referring to something biggest, like our bahavior in the world. That´s why I don´t know how to complete the sentence, I don´t have any idea about how the people or even how I can change something to become better. Maybe now, with the  simple fact to do my homework I´m doing something to change my own person, and maybe this would be good for the future of myself and my country or the human think… but who knows.\n",

I use to wear them but I combine with others too. I don´t think you show your mood with this, but for me is good to see people with beautiful colors. It´s like their mood is better that day. I don´t think is true, but I read that people in places with good weather they have less depression. Maybe it´s not true but maybe they have less colds.:)) Can change our mood with colors, weather and things like this?\n",

      "textContent--->I love radio!! o( >_< )0  I love it because I can learn new things about the world. I can hear the popular music, the news and some curiosities. xD I love to listen the radio at the night for two reasons. There is two radio stations, one of them the announcer (locutora) speaks in English, and sometime I can understand and others I have to investigate the things. The second reason is for the music, the music in the night is in other languages like English o German, and they play 60's-90's music. I love that kind of music xD I don't know why but I love it. I'm listening a radio station called exa. fm (it is on Internet too). They are playing some weird music. The weirdest is that I'm singing xD. My family watch me in a weird way when I sing. It's ok. My voice is awful. And the most part of time I can't pronounce the words but I do my best  effort. I really want to learn. Thanks for reading this entry. Have a nice day.

I am extremely happy and I am looking forward to attending the course in Australia. The first thing I would like to inform you of is that making the trip in August would be more convenient for me and for the company I work for, as in September I am usually very busy and have more responsibilities. On top of that (I wanted to use a synonym of \"In addition\", but I don't know if it's a formal linking word), it may also be of great importance for you to know that I would prefer to attend the speaking and listening classes because I ought to improve my conversational skills in my day-to-day life. With respect to the afternoon activities you mentioned in your e-mail, I would like to inform you that I would rather make a radio programme (I'm using the BrE spelling but I know in Ame you say \"program\") and learn to play a musical instrument, as both activities might offer me the possibility of boosting my confidence and my interpersonal skills. Finally, I would appreciate it if you could inform me about the accommodation available as well as what items of clothing I should take with me. I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience. Yours sincerely, Daniel\n",

I think it’s a great opportunity to study a language in its source country, right? I’ve been studying English since 1st grade. I like people correcting my writing in Spanish and English. Usually, I use Word’s spelling check, but sometimes when you correct it the meaning of the sentence changes. So, I also like friends and other people to check it for me so I can have a different opinion about it. I really like writing in the Internet. What I normally use is Facebook and Twitter; hopefully I’ll like posting here in Lang-8 too! This is a new experience for me, because on the other WebPages I have privacy settings and only some people can read my posts; in here I hope to get as many opinions as possible to improve as much as I can.\n",

      "textContent--->Using the internet to learn a new language Some people say learn a new language requires a lot of work and dedication, and is probably true! Beside the internet and movies I've seen in English, I was in a institute for 3 years learning English by reading and memorize its grammar. I don't like that system, so I've decided to learn Japanese without any instructor or institute, first just for fun, but rapidly I was immersed in japanese culture and customs. Learn a language does't imply just learn vocabulary and grammar, It involves the culture and people behind a particular communication system. I'm just a beginner now, but with a little help around forums and talks perhaps I would speak Japanese quicker than people who go in a institute 2 times per week.\n",

In addition, the domestic tournament, up to seven times has a 'hat trick', the last Saturday in the 'little hand' (5-0) over Atletico Madrid.

This summer I was far from the city and had little communication with most of the people I normally talked to. So I dedicated some of my writting. One of the few pieces of writing wasa kind of love letter I had never written before. I tipied it on one notepad and I titled it \"I love you\". It said: \"Only a pair of calls is not enough, knowing you are far away is not enouegh neither. I feel you beside me when the distance is short, and I really missed you when we are too far away. I'm happy when we meet, but it really hurts me when I see you leave. I love you.\" Of course it onle a kind of translation of what I wrote, and it was inspired in one person. However after finding it in my files and reading it, I still feel it is like the kind of stupid thing you write without sense when you feel inspired. ^^U..

Besides, I have been interested in learning German for a long time, but there has been no chance for me to attend a regular course. I am trying to study it by myself now. So, any one who is native German speaker or can speak German, please give me some advise~lol. The materials I am using now are movies in German and wikipedia~lol I think movies are good tools to learn languages. Because we can observe the motion and emotion and gesture and everything else on the screen to guess the meaning of a word that we don't know. What about everybody else? How do you self study a language? Oh, I almost forgot to say, I am still on my way to \"ultimate English\"~ My goal is to use English same as native speakers. I can speak well, but I still need to improve my writing and reading. ( my vocabulary is horrible when compared to people who are at same level as me~lol)\n",

I don't know whether it is a good symptom. Looking around the campus, unemployment is seen everywhere. There is even a saying goes, graduation means unemployment. Of course, dark side doesn't control everything, because some excellent students do abtain good occupations in large companies, and some even open up their small factories. however, not everyone is excellent in a society. From their smile and ambitious, I can image the picture of brave Polish chavalis in World War2. Some of them were lucky enough to chase with Russian infantry, but others just met a disaster, which was panzers. Anyway, all students have to graduate, only if you learn much and fortunate enough, you may at last get over the catastrophe.\n",

My favorite way to eat them is to eat them raw, i like the juice and the texture. Another favourite way is to use them as a sauce, it is a good match with fish and meat.

      "textContent--->Introduction/NB to Lang-8 My friend told me about Lang-8, about how you have the native people help you with the languages. My first languages are Cantonese and Mandarin, currently living in Canada, despite I've been living in Canada for over 9 years, besides my every day speaking and reading, my writing isn't the greatest. My grammar and spelling sucks :/ I'm also learning Japanese at this moment. And yes, my Japanese Grammar is the worse! And since I came to Canada after I graduated from Grade 6 in China, now, I don't know if I should say I'm fluent with Chinese or English, and collapse with Japanese. There are so many times that I can describe something with one of these certain languages. What inspired me to learn Japanese? Yes, looking at my pic you probably know it's cuz of Anime. Well partly? My greatest inspiration was actually Digimon. Something about this series grabs me in. It didn't just inspire me to learn Japanese, it also inspires me to learn and do a lot of things. Such as I started to draw more, and I like writing stories... etc. Yes, to become an animator, was also inspired by Digimon as well. I'm an animator, I really enjoy drawing and animating, as well as writing stories.(As I mentioned that earlier, and I hate reading for some reason...) In order to improve my English writing skills, I have start to write stories with English instead of Chinese. I'm currently Working on FanFictions for Kouji X Izumi Love Stories: \"時を流れる\" it's been on-going for over 120 something chapters, the FanFic is in Chinese. As I just started a new Digimon Novel, I should call it a FanFic as well, since alot of the characters are taken from Digimon, call \"Digimon The Knight of Sword\", typed in English. I might consider posting this story up here in the nearest future, and of course, please excuse my grammar D: And Feel free to give extra ideas and any grammar correction. Anyways~ CHEERS EVERYONE <3 -rainmon\n",

      "textContent--->What are important considerations in choosing a job/career according to you?  Introduction  I think there are some considerations in choosing a job, like the field of the  job, the location of job, the satisfaction of job. First of all, It is important to consider the field of job when choosing a job, because the field is related to the future of the job. Otherwise, you may not continue it long. Secondly, the location of job is also a very essential reason. To commute your office, transportation is a big issue, if the road to your work place happens traffic frequently,      which must bring you lots of inconvenience. Lastly, the job`s satisfaction is key factor to make you decide the job. If the job could satisfy you, you like it, so you can devote yourself to it voluntarily, and it will also motive you. In sum, there are many considerations to hesitate when picking up a job. As me, I will decide majorly by the field of job, the location of job, and the satisfaction of job. Of course, they are not just limited the factors that I mentioned above.\n",

I left excited and came back tired; my skin left light and came back. As you see, I was so negative when my first day at school, even I became homesick once I got on the bus. All things are better when I saw my roommates. They were back earlier than me to school and adjust themselves to fit the new semester. They shared their funny experience in summer vacation and send me the special food from their hometown. My roommates were so friendly and made me warm. But the first day at school seemed a little long. First of all, I had to clean up my drawers which I even didn’t know how to start. It took me two hours to move in and moved out my mother’s food and which I often companied at home. The last but not least the enormous pressure from the new semester, the difficulties for my major would be improved and I was anxious for the unknown challenge. To face the unchangeable, accept it.

Instead of using the combination of numbers and letters that you have created right away, you actually have to submit it to the Transport Department of Hong Kong for approval (just to make sure that it's not foul language or something I think), and they'll put it on auction where you can bid whatever you want (and you can even give up yours and bid another one lol) I've picked some number plates that I like quite a bit.

      "textContent--->Birds of a feather flock together When in primary school,we were taught to classfy different things. We had ever answer this kind of question,like that,for example,here it is an apple,a pear,an orange,a desk,now please select out a different one. Naturally,we would choose “the desk”. In our daily life,it is not easy to see the different animals getting together,because they would always stay with whom is similar to themselves. From these phenomenon,we can make a conclusion, “Birds of a feather flock together”. After hearing this sentence,there is no doubt that it would remind us of another one,exactly, “people of a kind fall into the same group.”Apart from the animals,human beings are included. In the ancient times,different countries would exist different class of people,. For instance,before our motherland was founded,bourgeois and proletarian were existing at the same time,and nowadays,proletarian can be sort into workers,farmers,merchants and so on. That is why we had this saying “people of a kind fall into the same group”. Different kind of people have different ideas towards this proverb. Some people are opposed to this phenomenon because they believe different kind of people can also get well along with each other. If we always adhere what the proverb said,gradually,it is dasy to appear the ethnic discrimination,which will be detrimental to the people all over the world. Consequently,we should make an attempt to get along with other kind of people,so that we can make a harmonious world better. From my point of view,however,I think it is normal to let the same kind of people get together. First and foremost,I believe the same kind of people staying together doesn’t mean they are not friendly to others. Instead,,they are making effort to preserve a better relationship with others. For example,in the industrial fields,the same kind of people getting together can use the less resources to accomplish the same product. In that way,they can be more efficient and richer. Consequently,our motherland can be stronger,other people can live more happily. So,the ethnic discrimination is not easy to happen. Secondly,this phenomenon can make people more competitive. The junior purse the lifestyle that is similar to the senior. In that way,our life will be more vivid. Generally speaking,the advantages of the same people getting together outweigh the disadvantage. So,I do subscribe to this proverb, “people of a kind fall into the same group.”\n",

      "textContent--->Super Market Don't Mean Super Convenience Nowadays, more and more local shops have been replaced by large supermarkets. Some people believe that supermarkets can provide more variety of merchandise as well as lower price. But I don't see eye to eye with them and I reckon that supermarkets produce more trobles than conveniences. I have two reasons to support my views. For one thing, the supermarkets are very crowded especially on weekend and holidays. Imagine that you just want to buy a bottle of water, and you have to wait for more than half an hour to stand in the line at the cashier. For another, generally speaking, sipermarkets are far away, some people have to drive a long time to reach the supermarkets. No one would spend such a long time to buy a bottle of drink. From the foregoing, a conclusion can be drawn that supermarkets don't mean super convenience, and I strongly suggest that more locl shops should be kept.\n",

It is absolutely heart-warming to be back here after leaving for ages overseas , but i feel oddly strange about the place which  has changed dramically in the course of time . I really want to tell you about this . Once i had stepped off the plane when it had arrived  , i took a look around passionately under curiosity and enthusiasm . I found that the place has really changed and it is way different to the place i remebered . I remeber outside the airprot was planted with lines of trees and flowers and there was a park full of children' laughters , hawkers was making their businesses and most buildings were only a few levels high . Now they have all gone , the trees were hacked somehow , the flowers were killed by the smoke exhauted by cars , children are no longer playing in the park , i believe , they prefer staying at home playing computer games instead , the hawkers are forced to end their traditional businesses because of the restriction of the government and the buildings are just like completing their heights with each others . Sky-scrapers are bloking the sunshine that everyone has to walk under their shadows . I sighed how on earth could everything has changed so much quickly . I really miss the old place that i know full of trees and flowers , i miss the annoying shoutings of hawker which i found it harmonical now , and the scense of children having fun in the park , the old buildings which allow you see the whole view of the sky . Dispite of what i want , they are all gone and seem never going to be back , but who can help , this is inevitable under the development of one place and we can only accept it . So i am trying to get used to this . Now Hong Kong has become a really unique and prosperous place , it is quite a sight actually , i think you should visit Hong Kong sometime . Chris Wong\n",

      "textContent--->The Hangover - movie of 2009 Recently, I have watched a comedy released in 2009 – the Hangover. Dough, getting married in a few days, was having his Bachelor Party in Las Vegas with his 3 best friends. However, this went terribly wrongly… Awakened in their hotel room, the three hung-over groomsmen found themselves with a big mess – a leopard in the toilet, a missing tooth and an unknown baby. More importantly, the groom was missing, so as their memory! None remembered what happened the night before, so they needed to retrace their steps and discover what was happening. But time was running short, the wedding was coming up. Can they bring the groom back to Los Angeles for his wedding? Or the bride would be disappointed while her husband was found nowhere. If you have been to Las Vegas, you would find this movie familiar, as most of the movie is taken there. There is a reason why I like it. I like this movie also because it successfully puttogether elements that were unrelated and you can hardly predict how they got there. The groomsmen were like detectives who traced the case bit by bit with the limited evidence they have got. The dialogues are carefully thought which laughter is expected throughout the movie. If you like comedy-kind, I would strongly suggest this movie to you!\n",

      "textContent--->Recent homework Here's my public course homework \"Britpop Culture\", to analyse 1960s,1970s,1990s Britpop songs that about \"love\") (这里是我公选课程英伦摇滚乐文化的功课，要分析60，70，90年代英伦摇滚中关于“爱”的歌曲) Love in three decades ——Britpop songs analysis Britpop is an important genre of popular music. As we know that rock music is a generic term for the range of styles that evolved out of rock’n’roll. In generally we can see the rockers’ attitude and views to the society or the world. Along with the times changing and developing, the Britpop songs have different style character in different times. Today I would like to analyse three songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1990s, which of these songs are all about love. In the 1960s Britpop songs, I choose Lady Jane ,which comes from The rolling stones’ first totally original album aftermath in 1966. The rolling stone is deeply impressed by the hippie movement ，also the anti-tradition culture is popular in the 1960s. In this song the reader can easily feel the love from the “I” to Lady Jane. The first sentence of the song is “My sweet Lady Jane”, it’s just like the front of a love letter, so sweet. “my love” has appearanced many times through the whole song, the writer shows how he love Lady Jane everywhere, even we actually don’t know who is Lady Jane, but we know that she is someone’s  true love. The writer tells that he’s Lady Jane’s servant anytime, he give a troth to her, when he bends his knees , we get that he’s poping the question to his lady. It’s a song that shows a man asking the lady to marry with him, it shows the pledge of the man, it’s pure hearted and romantic. We are touched by this love atmosphere. The lyrics are simply, the love is expressed straightly, I have already enthralled by this song. The second song is Don’t leave me now , comes from Pink Floyed’, the  album in 1979 ,the wall. Someone say that this album may be the most fantastic album in the world. This song is sad , it’s full of the writer’s puzzle dom. The writer is questioning and questioning, why his girlfriend will go away and how can she treat him in this way. It’s a heart broken guy’s roar in evidence. The 1970s is Glam Rock ‘s blooming time, the songs at this time is full of sensibility catharsis . In this age, many young people are concerning with how to express themselves better, you can even read the confusion of their thinking. This song can shows the people seeking for the answer between two people’s love, why the result will goes in this way, why the love will evolve like this. It expresses the confusion and suffering of the lovers’ broken-up. In the 1990s, I found a song from one of the greatest Britpop band during this period. It’s Radiohead’’s Creep. Creep is one of the favorite songs of Radiohead’’s fans. It’s embodied in Radiohead’’s first album Pablo Honey, which is terribly hit at that time. It’s a classical love song that make many audience listened in tears. This song is strongly filled with sorrow, anxiety and aspiration. The lyrics are straightly tells the writer’s interior monologue, it’s full of this poor man’s impressments. “You're so Fuck'n special, I wish I was special, but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.” You can see the complex inner conflict from the writer’s soliloquize, what a poor guy he is. I believe the lyrics here must arise many people’s resonate. After doing the research of Britpop songs in different decades, I have come to realize more great Britpop bands and know more about the culture and social background behind these songs. Britpop is really great and worth listening, you must be fond of it after you making friends with it. PS: there may still have many mistakes in my homework, looking forword for your correction~！ Thank you very much~!\n",

Afterwards,I've been trying to figure out the explanation for these errors one by one with the helping hands from some of my friends,the English native speakers. However,what's surprised to me most was that what they chose were exactly what I had thought was correct but which the so-called final correct answer said that I was wrong. :( you know,I believe that no one would rather trust the answers from the test creaters(出題人,all of them are Chinese even if propably many sentences were found out of the examples in a dictionary,)than the native speakers themselves.

Still I bought some little stuff like pins about Hetalia, which is still my favourite comic. It is about different countries, and even I don't have rich knowledge base about history, it gives me a lot of fun when seeing how the countries interact with each other. I return home with sore legs for walking around the fair for over 4 hours...

And finally,some people, expecially some hosts of industries, are shot in a sense of environmental,who pursue the maximum profit only . All of those lead to all kinds of pollutions like air pollutions,water pollutions,and soil pollutions, what could not be agnore any more,because they are badly harm to our humanity health. What could we do to stop the boosting rubish produce? Of course,the goverment plays the most sinificant role. the first one and the most important one,in my opinion,is to enrise the sense of environmental to every citizents. Car-pooling,conserving water and  electory used ,using environmental productions, and something like that,relates to our daily life. That seemse easy to do ,but contribute greatly to reduceing production of rubish. And also , the goverment should make a stringent laws to preserve our environment ,limiting the  production of rubish,expecially facturies as well as punish seriously who violate the law. Only with that the stress from rubish could be alleviate and our environment would become more healthful.\n",

      "textContent--->Need help with writing weekly... I have to write a summary of a news, but I really don't know how. A difficult time in Somalia, women need to work hard to provide basic needs for their family. They do almost everything to bring a living standard to their children, such as taking a job in Bakara market. Bakrana market is the biggest outdoor market in Somalia In the past, women in Bakara market used to sell tea or drinks. The situation has changed while more women are doing the jobs that are previously considered as men’ job. Not only the widows(*1) take the men’ jobs, the women whose husbands are still alive are also working because many men are unlike the women; they are not willing to do something for their children. The market is very risky because it is a fighting ground of the Islamic insurgent groups and the government force. There are many gun-shooting and killing; ironically, more and more women are working at there. Mohamud is one example among those working women. She has five children, but she has to leave them everyday. She needs to go to find a job at Bakara market; she has no other choice because she needs to feed her children. Some days, Mohamud can find a job for washing clothes; the other days, either a cleaning job or a guarding job. After working a day, she usually earns $1.5 USD. Despite she had lost many friends in the market, she decided to continue to take the risk because she can do almost everything for her children. the original article is this one http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MYAI-7WU8YB?OpenDocument&RSS20=18-P\n",

      "textContent--->How do I understand a shopping space? How do I understand a shopping space? A wet market visit: understanding customer behavior For the first outing, we chose to do something unique. We decided that we would like to study the customer behavior in the wet market in Sham Shui Po. We stayed in the market to stay focused on its customer behavior. The sellers in the market have no flashy advertisements, but they have a raw slogan banner. That said, the message is easier to understand. The display of the goods is not well-organized, but customers are enjoying shopping in the wet market and searching for real bargains. This is because of 2 factors; one is the collective shopping experience and the other is the cheaper price of the products. Festival wall visit: understanding how a modern shopping spaces operate For the second shopping mall outing, we need to go to Festival walk to observe its operations. I can see that the layout plan of festival walk is very humanized. The wide shopping corridor, the high ceiling, and the wise setting of the escalator enhance the customers comfortable experience. Also, the standardized shop font, glass walls, and clear separation of zoning gives the feeling of liveliness and brightness. The signs, graphics, and patterns are also very uniform to avoid customer confusion. What have I learned in shopping spaces lessons? Lessons of shopping spaces allow us to know more about the story behind operating a retail shop or shopping mall. From the design of master planning and layout and interior design to the marketing strategy are those involved. Besides that, I know that a successful shopping space should also create a shopping experience, like applying the five senses to the design. About the design master planning: we need to think about the customer flow (circulation), flow of goods (logistic) and the basic restriction of the building needs. In one of our workshop, we need to organize a 10metres x 10metres shopping space. We need to focus on not only generating the shopping experience, but also making good use of the space itself. If we only focus on how to create a good shopping experice, it will finally come down to the problem of not obeying the building laws. I understand that there are restrictions before I do a project and design. Moreover, there is sharing of brandy (shopping mall designer), supplier, and horace (experienced retail shop designer). Their sharing gives us a closer tough to the real design business. As design students, we do need to explore the real world of design as soon as possible. Those meet in the real world: the importance of material chosen, the restrictions and the marketing strategy. How do I apply lessons learned in our design? As we come to the final stage, we need to revolutionize a product and make use of what we have learned in the previous lessons. We chose a nostalgic game, airplane chess. We would like to revolutionize the game to a more recreational game. We study other similar games’ successful factors and then try to merge them into our own design. Based on what we have learned in previous lessons, we tried to first set our target user and analyze the factors to increase the interest of playing the game. We think the game should be something about promoting the joy of sharing among the family. We also think of promoting strategies, like the brand cooperation and band extension that was learned in the previous lessons.\n",

Jealous or envy, one could say, but there was definitely anger and unhappiness in me. She who had once my girlfriend has chosen to do lots.

So I hastily started looking for my mobile which I usually use as alarm clock. I thought I had turned it off unconsciously and that now it was somewhere in a bedding. In a hurry I checked under the pillows, under the duvet, on the floor around the bed, but the mobile was nowhere to be seen. I stood up and only then noticed that my mobile was lying on a chair. I had deliberately put it there so I had to stand up to turn it off instead of turning it into a \"nap\" mode. I checked what time it was. It was 5.59 am, a minute before an alarm clock would go off.\n",

      "textContent--->Book's review If you could correct this text, I'll be very thankful :) This is my book's review. The last book I’ve read was ‘Crime and punishment’ written by Fiodor Dostojewski. At first, I did not want to read it, because it is prescribed reading (and I think prescribed readings are boring), after all I’ve decided to read it. Furthermore, this book has interested me! The story takes place in Petersburg, big city in Russia, in 1866. The main character called Raskolnikow is an ex-student of the law. One day he decides to kill an old usurer who cheates poor students. He thinks, if he kill her, he’ll prevent yourself that he’s extraordinary person and he would change the world. After murder, he wants to get back his normal life, but he jumps to conclusion he can’t, because thinking of murder plagues him. He don’t want to meet with his family who he hasn’t seen from years, he don’t want to do something, all his life is thinking about murder. He can’t deal with fact he is a killer. In the end, he falls in love with prostitute and decides to plead guilty. He is exiled to Syberia, to hard work. When he’s working, he jumps to conclusion he has to change his life – he deals with murder and he want to start all over again. This is psychological book. In my opinion, it’s a bit long book who tells about human’s psychic and prevents us somebody can be a killer.\n",

      "textContent--->How do I learn English? I thought it would be a nice idea to write how do I actually learn English, so you can use my method, too. How am I immersed into English? Usually, for as much time as I can, I am trying to surround myself with English. It can be everything: podcasts, something to read (books, articles etc.), movies, even music or something else. It's important for me to always have something to learn English from. But do I understand everything from these podcasts and books and other things? Of course not. When I don't know some word and I'm not at home, I check it in dictionary and put it onto regular paper-wordlist. When I'm back at home I put all of words from the wordlist into a program called Anki. If I'm learning at home, I put new words with their translations directly into Anki (paper-wordlist isn't required then). Sometimes I write something on this site (like today). The most important factor in my English learning is fun. If learning gives me no fun and it's boring, there must be something wrong with it. I think it's enough for today - this post is getting too long. Maybe I'll write a second part of this entry. You can use my method also for other languages, not only for English. If you have some questions about this learning method, don't be shy and scared. Just ask me them in comments. Until next time!\n",

      "textContent--->English entry 13 Long Time no entry, right? What do like more manga or anime? I like anime more, because I can't read manga. I don't mean my Japanese language abilities, I meant that I don't understand what's going on xD. It's pretty sad. For example I don't know how one of manga ended because I didn't understand 3 last shot's (I men this part of page in Comics) Understanding anime is easier, and I can even watch it in Japanese version, I can't do that with manga. Hmm why I don't understand Japanese comics , mostly because , onomatopoeias xD, in Manga drawings don't move , and this little katakana words say what person is doing, (Crying running etc.) some drawings are unclear or can mean two or more things. Any way reading manga for me even in English version is hard xD. Anime also have weak points, but I still prefer anime than manga . BTW. Do you have some Manga/anime recommendations for me? Please share.\n",

      "textContent--->pliss help :) I have a huge request for assistance in improving this work which I need for class. I would be very grateful. Our tour starts with the city of Wroclaw in dolny śląsk, located on the Odra River. Very nice place to rest, both tourists and inhabitants of Wroclaw is the Japanese Garden in Wroclaw. Suitable terrain, oriental symbolism, interesting plant compositions, a small waterfall, a pond with a bridge and many others enjoy the eye a break from reality here and feel the beauty of nature amidst the big city. Walking around Wroclaw, you may notice a small cast metal dwarfs. They are located in various places in most of the old town and show different situations, people and ideas. Their purpose is to promote Wroclaw. Children and adults but also have fun in Wroclaw Zoo. You can spend 3-4 hours and the best way to do during the nice weather. Many specimens are naturally in a confined space but most of the best looks on the catwalks. The zoo also will find a place where you can eat ice cream, casserole, and buy refreshments. On the street Jatki, whose history dates back to the Middle Ages is a monument in honor of animals for slaughter. In addition, along the narrow streets are arranged in numerous craft galleries. It is a charming place to visit. On the street Świdnicka held a big chunk of the old town there are sculptures of people supposedly coming out of the basement. It is a symbol of the underground struggle against communism and the revival in the era of Solidarity. Known Hansel and Gretel houses in the Market Square in Wroclaw attracts many tourists. Market Wroclaw is a place most charming - full of sights, attractions and cultural events. If you are tired you can come here to rest. If you do not know what to do - here, there is always something interesting. Boston is the cradle of culture and music, this is very much here and even a permanent place in the calendar are some events. One of them is the annual beat the Guinness record. Annual celebration of the guitar at the Wroclaw market, it is above all an opportunity to play together, meet, exchange experiences, and by the way, to beat a new Guinness record.

Waiting for you there, mass events, concerts, waterparty, juwenalia parade and many other attractions.\n",
      "textContent--->AIESEC CHINA QUESTIONAIR It's important for me, so I'd really appreciate if someone could check it. Why do you apply for Explore China? What do you want to get it from? What is your expectation of it? For 3 year I'm interested into Asian culture, especially Chinese, Korean & Japanese. It all started with pop-culture like music, film and dramas. Now I'm  studying Japanese Studies, but during them I've realised how big Chinese  influences are in these countries. Because of that, I'd like to get to know better China,  make Chinese friends and experience their daily life. I hope to be able to look at the world from perspective of Chinese even just a little. I'm also willing to create a bond between  Poland and China, share my passion with people in my country! And if it's possible  learn some chinese for better understanding and communication. Please suggest your attractiveness for you to be chosen as Explore China EP based  on your strength and weakness. I can easly addapt to new places, don't have a problem about staying with new people  and working with them. I'm always trying to  solve problems by calm talk, people just need to learn listen to each others. I have some  experience in organising educational events and workshops for kids. I was also sometimes helping with english my friend's siblings so I know how it looks, but I'm not afraid of trying new things! I must admit that is a little bit hard for me to talk about myself, I know  that I may be lacking in some things but I really want to do my best! What kind of material can you prepare for showing the culture of your country in a global  village? Beside of standard  historical & geography facts I can bring some photos or videos about  life in Poland. Prepare some popular music and movies, because I think that it's more interesting to show something rather than only talking. I can also cook some polish  traditional dishes or bring some sweets for example. What kind of cultural acctivities can you organize in a community? I'm pretty good at drawing, making cutouts and similar kind of stuff. I was thinking about preparing workshops with for explame making polish cut outs. Polish pavilion  at Expo in Shanghai was all covered with them so it could be interesting. I can also organize english classes or some activities including singing, integration games. How much do you know about Chinese culture, especially Cantonese Culture? I'm trying to keep track of current issues in China, I'm reading books about Chinese  culture and about China-Japan relations (that's because of my studies). So I'm not a  totall newbie when it comes to talk aboutI culture, but nothing can replace visit to China. Don't know so much about Cantonese Culture, but I started reading about it & about  Cantonese language recently. You need to organize to show what Chinese culture is like in your own eyes and appealing for culture protection. What's the workshop, which organized by you, would be like? Can't yet visualise how would look whole workshop, because I don't know what exacly my impression  will be, but I'd like to organize interesting workshop, interact with people, say something about what I  was thinking about China before visit, what where my expectations and how it really was. I want to talk how foreginers think about Chinese culture and what we can learn from it. What will you do if the audiences of the workshop know just a little English? I'd prepare some plan B, like earlier made presentation with Chinese subtitles, or flayers with main topics of workshops written in Chinese. I can also ask for a help from someone who knows Chinese  and in exchange later help that person in his/hers duties. Are you good at art, singing, dancing etc.? I'm pretty good at drawing and art, I like to sing and I'm not shy to do it, but my voice isn't extraordinary. I was dancing 1,5 year ballroom dance and then 2 years some hip-hop, but it was long ago. What do you think if you need to do a lot of preparation before you arrive? It's not a problem at all. I know that I still have many thing to learn ant it's a part of my self improvement. :)\n",

I've been trying to understand the concept of tenses for a long time and I'm still getting confused which one to use, especially when talking about past. I find it hard to explain to myself all implications that tenses have and remeber it so I can use them correctly. For example: I read in a newspaper that English is simple. I've read in a newspaper that English is simple. Is using past simple when no talking about specific time in the past wrong? I don't see any difference between these two senteces, for me they have the same meaning. But I wonder if maybe using specific tense implies something more than that \"English is simple\" and I'm not aware of it...\n",

The players do these sports to control theirs outbursts and self-defenses, function of organisms and reduce a level of fear. In the event of any injuries at these matches there is a medical attention. Furthemore each of players on the battle wear protective headgear, knockdowns and knockouts. In my opinion this is a good kind of sport and it haven't to be forbidden.\n",

      "textContent--->postcard Dear Ola We are in France now, actual in Marseille. We are staing here to next Friday. The weather is amazing, its sunny, really hot and the water in the sea is wonderful. The sea is full of octopuses , jelly fishes and maritime living animals. Also our hotel is fantastic, we have really exlusive and pretty apartment with the most beautiful seaview which i have ever seen. But in spite of that all, we have horrible time. You can imagine how horrible it is that we dont really care about this all great things. First of all workers of the French airport lost our dog!After flight we wanted to take away our luggage and Amol ... but we got only luggage. They have sent our dog to different continent!Amol is propably in China! Second thing is really bad organisation of local transport. They write in their leaflets that the bus is left from the hotel to city for free every day. Yeah, its true. But the bus is going there for 5 hours. ( and the distance between hotel and city is only 30km.  ) Another ''small'' minus of this holiday is food. You know that we dont like sea food so i was really happy when i red in their leaflet that they had ,, delicious food for everyone''. Unfortunately they dont , they serve only seafood. And last thing but the most annoing is stupid french people. They are so rude, they are propably think that they are the best in everything in entire world, and they treat tourists like worse people. They forgot that we are paying them, we give them a job!\n",

Fortunately, nothing terrible with my health happened. I have never touched a socket with wet hands again.\n",

      "textContent--->Ethics of war  Could you check it for me?:) It's first part of composition about ethics of war. I don't agree with this view but I have to write about it:( :) People have been fighting each other since prehistoric times, and we have been discussing the rights and wrongs of it as long as we live. So we would like to talk to you about the ethics of war, because we think that topic of  rightness of war isn’t clear. Of course,  most people say that war is one of the greatest tragedies and we shouldn’t  militate. But in the other hand, it’s fact that  after the end of Second World War , armed conflict didn't cease. Somebody  calculated that after 1945 there were about 2.500 (two thousand five hundred) conflicts in the world. They was civil wars* and interstate wars**. \tSo, one of the parts which we want to talk about is realism in international relations. It’s opinion that national interests are the most important and war isn’t bad if it defend our business. Realists believe that war is an inevitable part of an anarchical world system. They are very skeptical in matter of morality. They think that ethics hasn't nothing to do with the world of global politics, where only the strong can survive. War is good solution if something threaten our stability, independence etc. Wars are in places, where people are not able to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. In other words, the war may be necessity. Morality during the war is completely different from morality during peace. So we could conclude that soldiers can kills enemies of their country and such actions are fully justified. If rules of  international law, hinders a wartime, soldiers should disregard them. If war has begun,  state should do whatever it can to win.\n",

      "textContent--->Chocolate lover I love chocolate. Unfortunately, it makes me fat and I have to confine myself to eating it. That doesn’t mean I can live without chocolate. I can’t. Life without chocolate is boring. Since I’m not allowed to eat chocolate I had to find something else, that could make me happy. There’s a solution: chocolate milk! It’s not as fattening as bar of chocolate and tastes great! I only drink one cup of chocolate milk per day, but it helps me to say away from sweets. You can also find a little bit of chocolate in my bathroom. I had a gel douche, that smelled like white chocolate and honey (that’s what producer says, I can’t agree with that one). Last month my brother bought me a bath gel with cute cow on the packing. It smells amazing! Sweet chocolate, yummy! I’m a perfumholic, so I tried to find anything that smells like chocolate (and doesn’t make me feel sick). My choice was, of course, Angel by Thierry Mugler. Chocolate is one of the fragrance notes and I don’t have headaches after using this. I like this fragrance, it reminds me of sweets, but my mom says, I smell like flowers on grave… That’s ok, I don’t care. Today I used it up, and since I don’t have any money left to spend it on perfumes, I need to take a little break from using it. Good news about chocolate fragrances: I also have Angel Sunessence Bleu Lagon. The fragrance doesn’t remind of original version, but it turns me on! Chocolate in the fragrance notes is almost imperceptible. Since I also love lipsticks and lip glosses (wait, haven’t I say, I’m a shopaholic?), I had to buy something chocolate-a-like. It’s hard to find anything, that’s brown and looks good on my lips, because I’m very pale. I’ve made some mistakes, but finally I bought a lipstick and four lip glosses, that don’t make me look like an idiot. (Sorry for all mistakes, my grammar sucks)\n",

      "textContent--->Why do you think people attend college or university?  There may be many various reasons why people decide to continue their education after high school. In my opinion there isn’t only one reason that is decisive, and the decision is influenced by different factors. Everyone wants to have a well paid job, in which one can develop and derive satisfaction from. Having a master degree in a certain field can significantly enhance your opportunities in getting a job you want. University is also a great place to increase knowledge in subjects of your interest. University is a good learning environment, where you have tutors and other students to help you when you need it. It may be both motivating and beneficial. But attending university isn’t only about reading books and cramming before exams. They say that it’s the most beautiful time in your life. Prospect of constant parties, concerts and other social occasions appeals to many young people as much as a career to others.\n",
      "textContent--->English entry 18 Do you like mims? According to Wiki [A mime artist is someone who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a performance art, involving the acting out a story through body motions, without use of speech. In earlier times, in English, such a performer was referred to as a mummer. Miming is to be distinguished from silent comedy, in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch. ] Mostly it's a person who acts without voice. My favourite mime is Polish Ireneusz Krosny. Mime comedian. He is one of the best, he got a lot of awards for mimes and comedians. the best thing in mimes is that , that anyone can understand it , not matter what age, religion, or language does person uses. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaAGFOkj3aM Matura= Polish exam for adult (In High school ) VERY IMPORTANT I also like musician comedians, some of gags are also understand , some not. My favourite is Polish group \"Grupa MoCarta\" (Group of Mozart)  Unfortunately to most of gags you have to be familiar with old  Polish music ;( . One of my favourites is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrlYy8i0G3Y (Desks for notes) Nice watching !( You can find other performances by looking at Related videos) Do you know some comedians like that. (Generally not verbal?  ) Coz I don't understand English comedians .. :(\n",
      "textContent--->It's only a winter. Sometimes, in eighteen year old girl's life, it comes the day, when your contact lenses don't match to your eyes. When all your plans lose out with deficiency of motivation. When each friend of yours has his own business, which is not a meeting with you. When empty bowl after your pudding is laying on your desk and you don't take this to the kitchen, beacuse you're so lazy. When you even don't know what exactly song you want to listen! Yes. Today is that day in my life. A debut. First adult depression. It's strange, but it feels just like previous ones. I still have been complaing about my weight and myself. I don't want to talk with anyone. It's depression like some others. Nothing new. I've had the tricks for days like that day. I used to go for a lonely walk, wear a dress (self esteem, you know...), get my big red bag and... I was just going. Across Lucjan Rydel's street, to the Bronowice, till Armia Krajowa's Avenue. There was a bright, shinning sun above my head and breeze around. All bad things have gone. But now? Now it's a -18 Centigrades. It means: WINTER. If I went for a walk, probably I would die! But it's only winter... Relax... Few weeks... And I'll see flowers, leaves and sandals! Depression doesn't wear shoes like these ones. It will be SPRING. Soon. (I don't care about all these mistakes right now, but I'm sure, there are a lot.)\n",
      "textContent--->Dear Diary. It's end of my 'winter break'. Tommorow I have to wake up about 4 hours earlier than today. Last 2 weeks I was at home, so I was sleeping as long as I wanted. It was nice time at all. I did more than 100 maths exercises. Also I've started revising (and expanding) my English vocabulary (take a look at one of my word lists http://wd2.photoblog.pl/np1/201102/3A/86551811.jpg ) Valentine's Day is tomorrow. Actually, I think I don't like this day. I'm sure it's a big part of American culture and tradition, but in Poland... Not really. In my opinion, it's just another good possibility to sell stupid things. There are too many pathetic hearts or pink things in shops. Sure, some of these 'things' are good, but most of them are tacky and tasteless. You may think that I'm jealous, because I'm single. But hey, even when I'm in love, I still think that pink hearts with 'I love you' all over it are not cool :)  Even though I don't like commercial meaning of this day, I'm going to make some drawings for my best friends and give them some chocolate tomorrow. But I'm doing it quite often, not only on that day.\n",
      "textContent--->:) Further findings of Bak (2009: 46) present that 94,7% of the respondents does not participate in activities in their close surroundings. Asked the question whenever the respondents participate in the activities for the goodwill of the municipality, 93,8% of the respondents answered that they do not. Asked if they feel that the local authorities are reliable in solving issues within the community, the majority of the citizens agreed that they are. It means that the problem-solving mechanism in Bielsko-Biała has developed its own characteristic way. \tAnother alternative for the lack of civic engagement in Bielsko-Biała might be the role of enterprise. It might be claimed that the collective action problems are solved by enterprise. This form offers a solution to social problems, and the individuals are immediately rewarded for their contribution. This explains the dynamics of the society in Bielsko-Biała. Bearing in mind that the enterprise replaced the need for civic engagement, the citizens in Bielsko-Biała created their own alternative to the collection action. \tThe civic engagement of the citizens in Bielsko-Biała is low, while the performance of the town institutions is rated as high. The satisfaction of citizens of this performance is also reasonable. It means that the town and its citizens have found their own specific way of dealing with the problems of collective action. Presented in the analysis data shows that citizens find solving collection action problems a task of the responsible officials. The satisfaction from the institutional performance is high, which possibly causes the passive position of the community in solving social problems.\n",

They had very good materials which facilitates learning. Among others they had short movies with scenes performed by the trainers. One of those movies was with a small error. After the scene an cameraman  didn’t switch off a camera and we could watch a few sign not being a part of scene (which was: a student coming to university office). In a first moment the trainer was ashamed, so we was thinking that she signed in the movie something not very nice. She understood that and she immediately decided to join this “illegal” part to whole exercise. So we also learned this last signs. Thanks to that I will remember to end of my life how to sign: “hey!

Even though we were supprised by the fact that weather spoiled a minute when we reached our destination - and from the beggining of summer vacations to this moment on every day was  sweltering, we were still in good mood. \tWrocław these time was a vibrant city. Four of us  watched 3 films a day, eatting out somewhere in a city and then gather together in the late evening. \tWhen the end of our staying approached, me and my friend Sonia decided to go from Wrocław straight to another destination instead of returning home – she chose Hel and I chose Białystok We checked train schedule and it turned out that both trains start off about 5 a.m.A little discouraged, but desperated to extend our vacations without parents, we went to bed early. After a couple hours of sleeping, I woke up (my train set off a leattle earlier then hers) and like a lunatic I washed, grabbed a suitcase and ordered a taxi. When I reached a station, the train was already there. I entered it and as we were setting off, I asked a chunky man to put my suitcase in a hutch. And then I became stunned. I realized that I accidentally took Sonia's suitcase because they were similiar in a dark. She rang me a few minutes later and confirmed my mistake. \tWe had no choice, and we accepted this accidental switch. However, a stay without my stuff wasn't so great even though I borrowed a few things from a friend of mine in Białystok.\n",

I should consider about any thematic series. Today I'll try to tell you about my car :) I receive it from my parents because they change car for new one. I have a car powered by gas (not gasoline but autogas - LPG). Car powered in this way is much cheaper in keeping. In Poland it's very popular way of replacing petrol, cheaper substitute. Recently, after refueling my car didn't want to start. I really don't know why. It's quite old (it has twelve years) and I know because of that it is a much bigger probability it break down in the most unsuitable moment. Fortunately, autogas isn't the only one way of powering in this car. Autogas works like \"overlay\" on petrol, so the only thing I had to do is switch it off. After few hours everything back to normal (without any help and fix). It's a charm of old cars :)\n",
      "textContent--->Hello, first post:) Hi everyone. So, this is my first post on this page. I must admit, im not convinced that anyone would answer me, but still i want to try. I would like to write a little bit about my english. First of all, i don't have occasion to talk in english. I try to read books or watch movies but i can't talk back or speak to someone and therefore i lack a lot of words. Then, second, often i use word or sentences i've heard in movies or games and i'm not pretty sure i could use them in common talk. You can, my english is rather poor and very, i've missed this word and i don't want to check it in translator:), stiff? Not flexible. I think, it's enought for a first post, thank You for reading this post and i'm looking forward to any answer. Cheers:)\n",

She doesn't have alzheimers or anything, you can talk with her, she's able to do a lot of things despite her age. She only has some major problems with walking, but her mind is as young as mine, I think. So anyway, I hope I'll stay here at Lang-8 for a little while and maybe make some friends, who knows.

      "textContent--->bored This is such a boring day. I woke up to early and it already made me upset. Later I have few appointments and few errands to run which I suppose to start already but I can't force myself to do it. Lack of motivation and focus always was my issue. I just registered to Lang 8 with hope that at least I can finally improve my writing in English. I've done IELTS in the past and my results were pretty good however my writing always was a disaster, I manage to achieve only 5.5 from writing! If you will compare that to 8.5 from reading, 6.5 from speaking and 8.0 from listening then it shouldn't be for you a surprise that I'm dissatisfied with that kind of result. At first to improve my writing I started to read more, and I'm not talking about film subtitles anymore. I started to read books and articles, I realize that my reading was pretty good however I started to read not only passively but I mainly focused now how it is written. I really believe that this will improve my writing finally if I will constantly try to do it and add using lang8 with it on regular basis. I really had no subject prepared for today, so as my start here I wrote about my previous experiences about writing in English and how I hate mornings. At afternoon my writing would be probably much more optimistic. Anyway I hope someone will check and correct it, plus that I will get some advice on which aspects of my writing should I focus.

      "textContent--->Hello Hello, I have just returned from the Dąbki resort. I was there for 2 weeks. It was really relaxing and interesting time. During that holiday period I have completely forgot about the reality... Kama- you have asked me to  make descriptions of books that were mentioned on my blog before. It is not easy , but I will try: “The Idiot” tells a story of the prince who returned to Russia after the medical treatment taken in Switzerland ( he suffers from an epilepsy) . Despite a good and simple way of living he faces many misunderstandings  and suffers much in his native country. “The story of a soul” is an autobiography written by the Carmelite nun who is better known as a little flower. “Rozmowy z katem” is a sort of interview conducted by an Home Army`s officer. The interviewed person  was J. Stroop – the  general of an german army. They  have met each other  in the prison  in Warsaw just few months after the second World War. By the way- the presented photo was taken in Dąbki.\n",

It has about 400 pages, so I think I will menage this in a month. I lend this book because I need to learn some vocabulary and try written language, which is different and much harder that for example while we are talking. In my opinion learning vocabulary from books is excellent , because 1. We learn vocabulary with a context. 2. We learn a lot of synonyms. 3. We learn how to understand the sentence without knowing a word of two in a sentence. 4. It's so fun . I usually don't read books, but If I had to I would read it in foreign language xD. (Two bird with one stone) I know that reading normal books (I don't mean this books for English learners that has 1000 vocabulary, are boring and short) will be hard for me at the beginning but I hope that after two or 3 books it will become easier and easier!. What do you think? Is this method really works?\n",

Tomasz has been a joy to have in class. He is an independent, self directed person who is able to communicate effectively and meet even the most demanding challenges. While in my class, he was always respectful and diligent student. Tomasz is representative character with highly dedicated in improving his efficiency. His Chinese improves really quickly what is shown by his good grades. Moreover, Tomasz is strongly interested in Chinese culture, what proves his Dissertation topic which is “Chinese mythology”.

      "textContent--->Let's talk about King Arthur Today will be about legend's of King Arthur and his knights. Since I have seen \"Merlin\" on BBC  I'm fascinated in this topic. I know that this story is a little naive (I mean BBC  serial), but I like it mostly for wonderful music, costums (Morganas dresses are extraordinarily) and pictures. I won't forget a scene from first (or second?) season when Morgana in purple coat, looking like a Little Red Riding Hood for adult, was walking across winter forest and been attacked by scorpions (or what else was it). In was almost plastic, just like a painting. Well, that was some time ago. Now, I try to learn something more about Arthurian legends. Actually I have been reading \"The Mists of Avalon\" by M. Z. Bradly in english. I quite enjoy it. The story is concentrated mostly on women, Morgaine, Igreine, Viviane and Gvenhwyfar. I don't like the last one, she seems childish and pretentious. Strong advantage of the book is authors orginal point of wiev on \"old religion\" involving Great Goddess, magic etc. and her dissapointment on Christians who doesn't understand that \"All gods ale one God\". By the way, I would be very happy, if you could recommend me some good books which are more concentrated on Arthur and history of Albion.\n",

      "textContent--->censorship in Poland Probably not much of you know that after collapse of communism, in polish television we still have a censorship. I've started this post in a bit controversial way to gather your attention. To be honest there is no blue pencil as it was in times of communism, but i want to tell you about thing on polish TV that is really annoying me and, in my consideration, is totally hypocritical. I'm talking about censorship of swearing in foreign movies translated for polish TV. Maybe you don't know, but in polish language there is loads of ways of insulting someone or speaking in rude way. When it comes to swearing, polish language is much richer than english. You can use words like kurwa (whore), chuj (dick) and pierdolic(to fuck) in so many ways and meanings (both, positive and negative). And to be honest majority of Poles uses those words without any hesitation in everyday conversations. In most of polish tv stations, foreign movies are aired with lecturer reading polish translation. But in every station they are censoring the screenplay by replacing swears with some polite equivalents. Maybe it is fun for first few times to hear criminals in movies like scarface or dangerous minds talking like kids in kindergarten, but in general, in my humble opinion it is rather pathetic and indicates that tv stations treat grownup viewer like a retard. Btw. polish movies are not censored this way and you can hear loud \"Kurwa mac!\".\n",

      "textContent--->Rewiev of a book \tCleverly  and skilfully written, Dan Brown's first novel, Digital Fortress is regerded as one of the best techno-thriller novel ever written. The story is set in United States and the plot centres on human right of correspondence privacy with National Security Agency in the background. \tThe action starts when the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious and ingeniously complex code called Digital Fortress that it can not break. The agency calls in Susan Fletcher, a brilliant mathematician and their head cryptographer, to crack it. She realized that the code is a viral program designed to break down NSA's head computer and discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with intrusion into people's private lives. The NSA find themselves in a position of needing to intercept and destroy the algorithm before it can be released to the world and render their spying efforts useless. \tOne of the things i like the best is the breath-taking plot which will hold the attention of reading every page. Book is full of unexpcted twists of action and we do not know who is truly the terrorist and who is actually freedom`s guardian. My only criticism of the book is that the novel has a lot of chapters and you need a lot of  patience to read it but Digital Fortress is surely worth your time. \tAll in all, if you are a fan of thrilles you will love this book. And if you are not I would still recommend it because Digitall Fortress contains amazing story which let you drag away from grey reality and certainly change your opinion about thrilling books.\n",

She never wonder about uprising's point, although she lost then a lot of friends. During military conflict between German's army she was helping wounded in Veterinary Institute in Praha, when was the hospital. Fighting spirit for independent was so strong that nobody disagreed with people living in Warsaw. Father who was locked in German's camp thought about it extremely different. He had no doubt that it was unneeded waste of people's lives. After message about uprising came to camp everybody there was depressed.

(How is that ? ;)  )  When I first read this book, I could not  go through like more of the half, but when \"The Sacred Garden\", became my obligatory book , and I had to read it, it was so compelling that I devoured it extremely fast. Book written by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is absolutely heart taking, or was when I was a child. It is a adventure book , about  obnoxious girl, who become a orphan. She is sent to a mysterious house, to her relative. Mary is lonely as before, but she do not have anyone to order. Despite  dreadful behaviour of hers, she gain sympathy of  housekeeper. At night Mary is being woken up by some strange voices. Girl wants to solve a mistyfing source of noises at night. Plot was good, very interesting, and it definitely keep me amused for hours. I choose this book as one of the best from my childhood because, I was touched by it, and it tells about important things, of every kid, friendship. I definitely recomend this book to every child, but if that happend that some adult have not read it you should pick this one. 192 words, I should wrote some more (250) ... but it's just for education, I am still learning how to write this :)  Please correct and tell my why I am wrong, and If style and build of Review is correct.\n",

If you are working in field where very important is time of spreading information, I think I have noticed that the cost of making a translations are to high compared to learning language in which you will usually get information. Ages ago there were another International languages like Greek or Latin. I think English will not be an exception and it will also pass away from global scope. This not may take years, but maybe decades or even more, but I am sure that this will happen someday. If I have to point to another language, that can take this role, it would be a Chinese. I am really wondering about learning this language. I am not sure however, if this kind of motivation (usefulness) is a proper trigger. What do you think about this?\n",

It's about love ;) I have to know that the person is the right person. Maybe I will find a perfect person for me in this year but I need time to know her. I think, a year is too little :) But I know one thing, for person I love, I'm ready to do everything and try to spend with her all time ;) Even if she is from Turkmenistan or other part of the world :) It doesn't matter :)  The main issue in relationship for me is to do almost everything together, to be a unity and understand ourselves without words. For me, the case is simple. If I had a girlfriend from other country, one of us should move to live together. A long-distance relationship doesn't work in my opinion. Do you think you should follow your husband no matter what he say? I really don't know. It depends on relation between husband and wife. In my opinion it shouldn't be a rule. They should make decisions together and choose what is the best for their relationship. It's important to be open minded and to look for common goods. A husband shouldn't be a taskmaster and dictate what is good and what is bad. A husband and wife should support each other.\n",
      "textContent--->most exciting day of my life It happened 07/07/2007. I slept when suddenly I felt a strange vibration. Vibrate not only my room but also every part of my body. Poured me a cold sweat. I was wondering  it's a dream or waking ... Suddenly exploded  window in the roof. When I looked up I was blinded by bright light. I was afraid, but I still looked  in that direction because I wanted to see where is  the source of light. I slowly rose from my bed ... Every second seemed to be hours ... And then I saw something that is beyond human comprehension. In my room materialized alien. He was tall and very slim. He had a big, yellow -violet eyes and blue skin. He touched my shoulder  and  in one second we were on the spaceship. That what I saw cannot describe in words ... Fear took the place of curiosity. Alien showed me many amazing things. He introduce me to other alien, and therefore I could talk with them for a long time. It was very untypical conversation because they didn't  move their lips and I heard everything in my mind. I spent there  many hours. I was fascinated by their technology as well as the principles which they profess. At the end of the journey, I found out  why they contacted with me. They searched people who will be their ambassadors between their race, and race of people. They wanted  teach me everything about them  and someday in the future when appropriate time comes I could explain another peoples in the earth who are the newcomers from space. I agreed... I woke up in the morning and I didn't believe what happened. I didn't tell nobody, what I experienced. Now I'm waiting  for the next meeting... Waiting for the next most exciting day of my life.\n",

      "textContent--->Lost and found I've been always wondering why whenever I look for something I always find it in the last place possible. Have you ever experienced that? This/that is so annoying! The/a funny thing is I've recently seen a note on that awfully annoying situation in a science magazine published in Poland. A reader wrote a letter asking why it always happens so. And some wise journalist answered: we tend to find lost things in the last possible places because when we find them, we stop looking for them. I read it and thought - what a nice and neat answer. At first it seemed so simple and obvious but now the more I think of it, the more wrong it seems. Because it's simply not true. Just imagine. If it was true, after you'd found the missing stuff, there could still be some places left unsearched (I don't think there's a word like this...) and there usually aren't! When I find something, I always find it in the last possible place I could look for it - it's a fact! There is a notion which explains the situation, in Polish it's called \"zlosliwosc rzeczy martwych\" - I'm not using diacritics. No idea how to translate it into English, wait, my dictionary has just come to my aid, here you go: the perversity of inanimate objects. Hm, I don't like this translation very much but it's a good dictionary and it's probably better at English than I am, so the translation must be correct. Thanks for reading my idle chatter :) Comments will be most welcomed/welcome (?).\n",
      "textContent--->English in a Programmer's life - part 1. Part 1. I know that my English is not on this level, which is acceptable even for me, but I think, that I should try do something with this. We all should do something with the most important language for programmers! English is very important, but we can't expect that someone will teach us. Program of studies could be better. We know many fancy words, but often we can't express even our opinion about things which we are interested in. When I started work the biggest challenge was for me to switch to English. In our company English is the official language. I think that I am quite open mind person with a lot of ideas and question to ask, but sometimes when I need express something in language which is not my native, I am feeling a little confused. Of course this is natural, but if I want to be a person who want to achieve something special in my programmers live I need to be more world-wide! Many times I decided to do something to improve my English in significant way. Few years ago I decided, that I will be asking uncle Google in English (If I have to be honest, then I decided that I will try ;) ). This was not easy, but quickly I realized that web become much bigger for me. Since then googling is much easier :) Reading books written in English - this was also being very important step for me. I remember which foreign book was that first which I read from desk to the desk. It was . NET Book Zero. After reading this (btw. great and free - available online in pdf) book, I understood that sometimes choosing this (in theory) more difficult way, I can achieve something more quicker than by choosing (in theory) easier way for my - reading something about C Sharp in polish. Why? This is not obvious? In English there is much more content in the web and even probabilistic tells us that this mean, the perfect book about your favorite programming language is written rather in English than in Polish! So why we are wasting our very expensive time for reading not the best materials? That's enough! Lets do something with this!\n",

I thought, that even though it`s a romantic comedy, it would be worth seeing. But it wasn`t! Trashy, boring story about sex-friends. All the time I had a feeling, that I saw it million times, I knew there would be a happy ending and I was thinking only about: why she did that? What for she played in that movie?

I've been learning English language for few years but I think I can't use it very well. Speaking is what I find the most difficult to me. Unfortunately I don't know any English speaking person, so I can't practice my speaking skills. English grammar is a bit hard to learn for me because of much more tenses and complicated gramatical structures.

I don't really intend to improve my English here, but let's say if you correct this entry it's fair 'n square :D I'm making a little personal project and I'd like to ask you people to help me out a bit. Think about Poland for a little while and write down every association that strikes your minds. I mean everything: animals, vegetation, people (their looks, character, mentality), cuisine, weather, economy, political issues, customs, folklore, maybe some particular Poles you know, just anything that you think about when you think about Poland. It doesn't matter if you know anything about this country, whether you've lived there or have no idea what continent it's situated in, don't worry if you don't know whether what you think is true or not either. I just want to know how Poland looks like to people from outside this country. What kind of image does it create to the rest of the world and what kind of things are mostly associated with Poland. By the way, I'd better you simply listed those things or make some mental leaps rather than write a regular statement, because it's just easier this way. Thanks in advance, cheers from Poland :]\n",
      "textContent--->Sushi Bar Yesterday I was first time in sushi bar. Uncommon to me was the fact that before I even ordered anything waiters gave me a sticks, wasabi, sliced ginger, soia oil and of course a menu. I must say that they have very big variation of served food. After few minutes I told cook (Maybe he have some special title like sushi master but I don't know that so lets call him a cook) that I want green dish (because set of sushi is named from the color of dish on which it is served, different color = different food). Great idea in my opinion is fact that when you waiting for your food you can observe a cook or even talk with him because a bar table has got a big hole in the middle where cooks are preparing a food. When my food was ready and cook served it to me I took sticks from paper and then a new problem appeared. I don't know how to eat with sticks. Fortunately cook with the smile explained me how to use a sticks and told me that he can get me sticks with rubber band or I can eat with my fingers too. I chose last option because after few tries with sticks I give up. The food was delicious and after eating came time to pay a bill. I paid a bill and waiter gave me surprise, a small glass of plume wine. I'm waiting for another visit in sushi bar.\n",

I decided to improve my skills, since I'm stuck in a point when I watch movies with English subs or read some articles, but it's not anywhere near to fluency or level I'd be happy to achieve. I know that blog-like writing isn't really challenging, but it's a good point to start. ... Yeah, the REAL reason I've turned to English is that I blew my Japanese scholarship and I gave up the actual studying of it, although I'm still 'inputting' it. Maybe it'll bring better results, as so did my English 'inputting'. No, I'm just kidding. But only about the first part, unfortunately. Anyway, I'll decide about my next topic or maybe some kind of plot, maybe, after I see if there are a lot of mistakes here. Counting on your help, huh. Thanks in advance!\n",
      "textContent--->Torn apart Have you ever thought how hard is to choose a good major in studies? While most of the pupils enjoy the holiday wholeheartedly, future students stare at university's websites hopelessly. The pressure “Haven't you choose yet?“– said Dorothy's friend shaking her head. Dorothy replied something which always close everyone's mouth: “Can you propose me anything reasonable for humanists?” As time is passing by Dorothy feel more and more under pressure. The more advices she listens the bigger chaos she has got in her head. The fear that she will apply for an accidental major petrifies her. “ I wish I didn't ask anybody for the advices”. When dreams meet reality It’s not that she is not a gifted student. Conversely, she won many various contests, however all in the humanists field. Unfortunately what the job market demands are scientifically-minded people, the builders of future bridges and those who understand sophisticated mechanisms of market and thanks for that are able to sell everything. The fact is that after many of humanistic majors you are sure to be unemployed, even if you were an active volunteer, had got rich apprenticeship or the most prestigious scholarship. You can be the best sociologist but nobody will take on you until you will be needed truly. Happiness is too ephemeral to be something which you can rely on. “If I had choose the philosophy, I would have had to steal a bread from pigeons” – says Linda. Despite economy is not something in which she is really interested in, it gives her a comfortable feeling of safety on unstable job market. What about you? Firstly, you should be aware that nowadays hardly anyone works in his or her profession. Undoubtedly, making an agreement between passion, skills and prospect of job is not an easy task, however you should be aware that you're devoting not only your 5 years of studies, but, most probably, you all future life also.\n",

So I’m Sylvia and I’ve just finished a high school in Poland and received result of my matura exam. I look like a common teenager who wears different clothes and mix different styles. Neither I’m an emo nor a punk. I don’t like limiting anything. For example I like various kinds of music: from classical to electro through pop, rock or contemporary classical music. I’m a musician. I’m accordionist. I’ve been playing since 8 years and what’s more I decided to study in a music academy. But I got other hobbies like films and book. I’m fond of reading books which show people’s problems with drugs or anorexia. As for the films I watch comedies, dramas and sometimes horrors  but only when somebody induces me to do that. Spare time I spend like most of people – I go out with friends to drink beer , go  in the cinema or take part in at-home. Although I try to working on m English in spare time. I really like it. I do it by reading articles in the Net, watching films and listening song with lyrics. Recently I decided to join this website to improve my languages skills and help other people to learn Polish. Well then, they’re the most important things about me. If you want to know something more about me write me. :)\n",

      "textContent--->Grammar: I talked to my cat. According to an old Polish legend (i don't know does it exist in different cultures) in the Christmas Eve, near midnight all animals can speak human language. Let's try some grammatic then: It's X-mas so i plan to have a little talk with my cat. Because of X-mas, I'm going to talk with my cat. My cat will talk to me, because it's X-mas. My cat wouldn't talk to me, if there will be no X-mas. X-mas time is a time, when I can have a talk with my cat. X-mas is the thing that makes my cat talk to me. I was a little surprised when I was talking to my cat first time, many X-mas' before. My ability to talk to my cat is caused by X-mas. While celebrating the X-mas i will try not to forget to try talking to my cat. I realized that the X-mas are coming, when my cat begin to talk to me. I will not be able to talk to my cat for the whole next year, after the X-mas will end. I used to talk to my cat during X-mas. Finally, the X-mas arrived, so I'll be able to talk to my cat once more! I wouldn't mind if my cat will talk to me, because of X-mas. Well actually my cat told me last year, that it is a Muslim so it's not going to anything special during \"my\" X-mas. I was just talking to my cat as usual when suddenly, out of nowhere - the X-mas appeared! I hope my cat will be glad to have an opportunity to have a little talk with me this X-mas. Actually I had talked to my cat before, on the last X-mas. Since there are X-mas, I'll probably talk to my cat. Ey ppl i rly like xmas, coz yle its on, i can talk to ma kat! I like talking to my cat, which is possible because of X-mas. Meow meow meow, meow meow meow X-mas. Seriously, during X-mas I don't think talking to my cat is any weird. I hope my cat will be very talkative this X-mas. I used to talk to my cat, even if there's not X-mas. I hope my cat is not going to tell me, that it's not interested in talking to me, even during X-mas, because I really think that so good opportunity to have a talk is too valuable to be wasted for both me and my cat. That will be enough for now. Merry X-mas people, and don't forget to say \"hello\" to your pets! :)\n",

Dialogues breake into the songs, which performance is truly remarkable. They just makes you wanna stand up, sing and dance with other characters. Streep is the real star here although the other actors play in a gripping way too and it's impossible to get bored while watching this movie. 'Mammia mia' set in picturesque and breathtaking Santorini is a great choice for those who got stuck in their daily grind, unable to spend unforgettable holidays. It will allow them to get brief respite, relax and experience exciting adventure.\n",
      "textContent--->Hello!  Recently, I watched \"A single man\" movie with Colin Firth as a protagonist and briliant Julianne Moore. The story is about George who lost his lover in car accident and show one day - the most important day - from George's life. Very delicate and peaceful film. Pictures from this movie are great. Also music composed by Abel Korzeniowski with Shigeru Umebayashi help is moving. To sum up:  for me it's movie about true and passionate love. :) Now I'm fascinated with backpacking idea. It's just beacuse of Tomek Michniewicz's book \"Samsara\". It's about journey through Southeast Asia. I think it's great idea just to take your bag and go wherever you want to. The book inspired me much with the idea of wayfaring, so maybe one day I'll pack my backpack and go somewhere... . :)\n",

Maybe it will be boring, but i just have to write something. So, i would tell you about my holiday. Let's start. I spent about half of my holiday by the lake Jeziorak. It's about 15 km from city Iława. We have a small house there. Its in the centre of the forest, 100 meters from the water. Every night we are making campfire. With my parents, sister and dog we are sitting around it and talking about unimportant things. I enjoy it very much! In this holiday, weather wasn't very good, but it doesn't matter. We spend a lot of time together and it was great time. In other hand, i was at a trip (camp?) in Bulgaria. This part of my holiday was also great. People there were very friendly and we were partying all the time. We stayed at hotel \"Mak\" in Golden Sands. I must say - this place looks like a paradise. Beach was just awesome! In the morning we were swimming and sunbathing and in the evening and night we went to the clubs/discos. Enjoyed it too. :) So, i think its enough for first post.

      "textContent--->Hi everyone! Hi everyone! My name is Peter, I'm 20 and I live in Gdańsk, Poland. I've been learning English for over 13 years (wow, it's already that long... :D). The truth is that at the very beginning of my \"adventure\" with English, it was like once or twice a week at school, and everyone knows how much you can learn at school if talking about foreign languages. So, those \"13 years\" are highly exaggerated. I'm really glad I can understand almost everything what's written, and about - let's say - 95% what I hear. I've just found Lang-8 - it's exactly what I need right now! I feel that the only way I can still practice my English is some contact with casual, everyday English. I think watching USA and British TV series is awesome, 'cause it's both fun and learning. I've watched Monk, Desperate Housewives, some time ago also House and Ugly Betty. I think the first two (which I've watched till now) are easiest to understand, their English is just so clear I can easily watch them without subtitles. It was a little bit harder with House, probably because of a lot of medical terminology (\"tumor\" and \"concussion\" being only a tip of the iceberg). All right, that would be all for my first post. See you (or rather \"read you\" :D) in my next posts, bye! ;)\n",

Is it correct? I think it's not - I found there a few mistakes by myself (by example in the title - I should use 'an unusual' instead of 'a not typical'). So maybe it was boring or too long? ;> Yesterday, i found some very good, free e-book on the Internet. It's called 'Polyglot - How I Learn Languages'.

      "textContent--->VS 2008 question (Copy of a programming/VS 2008 question I asked on one forum) I'm working under Visual Studio 2008, maybe that's important. In a larger project I decided to split one of my . cpp files into two. As I moved some of the functions to a new file, let's call it new. cpp, and tried to compile, I got errors that new. cpp doesn't know definitions of fstreams, setw(), etc. Now, at the very top of the new file I included my own header, let's call it main_header. h, which in turn includes all the necessary fstream, iomanip, etc. This works just fine all throughout older files used in this project, but for some reason doesn't in new. cpp. If I add  #include <fstream> #include <iomanip> // and all the rest in new. cpp then all works just fine, but that's not how I want to solve it. I thought maybe content of main_header. h doesn't get appended to new. cpp on compilation, but that's not true, I tried using in new. cpp an external variable declared in main_header. h and defined in yet different . cpp, and got no errors on compilation, linking, or running. Yet it seems like fstream and iomanip included in main_header. h do not make it to new. cpp file. I'm relatively new to Visual Studio, so the solution to my problem is likely something silly I'm not aware of, but I spent a good while trying to figure this one out and to no avail. The new file is definitely part of the project, since building projects attempts to compile it, plus once I include iostream and iomanip in this new. cpp I can call its routines in other parts of the project. Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? main_header. h looks like that #ifndef MAIN_HEADER #define MAIN_HEADER #include <iomanip> #include <fstream> // loads of other stuff #endif\t// for MAIN_HEADER\n",
      "textContent--->Wrong E-mail, Very Shocking! A couple had been married for 20 years. They decided to spend the summer in the same hotel where they spent their honey moon, but the wife was busy, so she agreed with her husband that he would travel alone two days a head, then she could catch up with him later. When the husband had arrived at the hotel, he went up to his room, and found a computer connected to the internet. So, he thought that he should send his wife an e-mail to inform her of his arrival. Unfortunately, he sent this e-mail to a wrong e-mail address that wasn't his wife's. The wrong e-mail address was a widow's address who had just came back from her husband's funeral. She started checking her inbox going through all the condolences messages. Then, suddenly, she fainted. Her son tried to wake her up, but he couldn't. Then he read the following message which was displayed on the screen: \"My dear wife, I arrived safely. You might be surprised that you're getting my news via the internet. They have computers in here now, can you believe it? Now, anyone can e-mail their family and loved ones day by day. I have just arrived an hour ago. I checked that everything was set, just waiting for your arrival in two days time. I miss you! I wish you will get a fast and comfortable flight like mine. P. S: You don't have to bring a lot of clothes with you, its very, very hot in here. It's Hell!\" Very romantic to his wife; very shocking to the widow!\n",

But they do not know how it is to work in a small town in the summer where temperatures hit 50C °! Every time I spend July here , I became increasingly tetchy, and suporte less  the heat and the sensation of isolation! I wanted to take my vacation at least mid-July, but I could not because of work. Well, it's only five weeks ... There is an idiom used here to mean that the temperatures are unbearable, they say, even the camel bleeds (from nose) because the very high tempratures cause nose bleeds, and if the camel that is supposed to stand the heat, bleeds! It means that the heat is beyond human capacity!\n",
      "textContent--->Every one wins and no one lose. Thousands of people know that they need things from other people  but the shame owns them in the pursuit of what they need. Because they fear that their satisfaction and filling to their desires  just selfish of them. They also feel that their insurance for their success and their happiness mean that there is other will deprive from some  success or happiness. Let’s take it directly and say that the successful human relations  means give everyone else something else, what is needed  compared to anything else you need it. And any other method to deal with people will not produce or bear fruit. The three main methods to deal with people:- There is not the man who was self –sufficiency, all of us need to  do things others can provide it. You also have things which other people need them. All our dealings with people is based on this requirements and there are only three ways are being used in our dealt with other  people. 1-You can take what you need from you colleague by force, threat or deception although the criminal who are fall into this type of people. However, more of respected people restore  to use this way with more subtle methods. 2-You can become a beggar for human relations and begging the other to give you these things which you need. This compliant type of characters are dealing with other in this way will not impose my self on you and I will not cause any problem for you so in return  that you will be kindness with me. 3-You can work free from a base based on the fair exchange  or on the basis of give –and –take. Here your job is to give others  what they require and need then they should return your work and  give you the things which you need. I prefer the third method because it makes you happy when you help  people and make them very happy because they may be need  your help most. Also when you find some one help you in things actually you need his/her help most, you don’t know how can you thanks him/her. Keys of success and happiness. We need from life just two things . they are success and happiness. We all are different from each other and   our idea about success is different from one to another. But there is a major factor will put to teach us how we can be able to success and become happy. This is the same factor which found in each case whether you are a lawyer , doctor , a businessman or salesperson ,whether you are  a parent or just a sales clerk or even a housewife ,and so on. The scientific studies proved that if you learned how to deal with others, you are cut off 85% of the road to success in any business or job and 99% from the way of personal happiness.\n",

      "textContent--->Tipping Around the World A few days ago, I watched Oprah Winfrey Show. She was talking about tipping in a very dramatic way. It seemed like not tipping is a very rude thing to do. I didn't really understand what the concept of tipping means in the USA and other countries. So, I did a little research, and here is what I came up with: United States: It seems like one has to tip for everything is done for them. It's like showing appreciation. Thus, the one who doesn't tip is being ungrateful. In some restaurants, they just add the 15% tip to the bill. The BBC says,  “ For all those US males out there who pull out their little calculators every time they receive the bill, having the tip already indicated for them can save a lot of embarrassment.” Very awkward! Canada: It is pretty much similar to the US's tipping system. It also depends on which city and level of service. Tips in Canada range between 10-20%. A 15% tip is considered fairly good but if the service is very good, then you're expected to push this number more steps forward. Mexico: They say that tipping there is expected for almost everything (I really can't see the difference that it has from the previous two countries). Also here, a 15% tip is expected in restaurants. It's said that there are people who don't have any other source of living except for these tips. I find this very confusing because how is this called a job. I mean there must be a manager who hired this person and who is expected to pay him, as well. Coming back to Mexico, If you're taking a taxi, you should check the metre as you enter the cab. If it's broken, you should exit, otherwise,you're expected to pay what the metre shows at the end of the ride. The tip can be lowered if the cab driver was giving you a hard time through your ride. France: The expected tipping percentage doesn't differ here from the others. The law in France states that the tipping price should be included in the bill. Customers should feel free to increase the tipping price unless they are feeling dissatisfied with the service (but I don't think one can decrease the tipping price for this reason). There are much more counties with many other tipping systems, but let'stalk about my own country. The article that I read about tipping shows tipping system in Egypt in a different way than what it really is. The writer says that in Egypt you're expected to tip, which makes it sound compelling. I think tipping here is considered optional. In other words, no one will fight with you if you don't tip, as the law doesn't state any rules for tipping. Therefore, tipping generally depends on one's generosity. To be fair, I agree with him on one thing, some workers might look aggrieved if you don't tip them. But as I said, it's completely optional. People get paid for doing their jobs. No matter how small they are paid, they should expect living on this salary. If they were tipped, then it's even better. But as getting tipped is not guaranteed, then the decision of taking a job depends only on the salary.\n",

I watch just few matches from the European Champion League and the Italian Championship. When it comes to the World Cup, I became addicted; I have to see almost all the games, know all the teams playing; their players, their coach, results... This year was a little different, since our national team qualified to the World Cup, I watched some of their qualifications matches So when I saw the list of players going to South Africa I was not surprised. But when I take a look on other team’s lists, I didn’t recognize a lot of names; because I’ve forgot some of them since 2006, but mostly because they are new. My big surprise was when I saw the Italian list and there was no Del Piero on it!! I looked for Buffon, Canavaro and Camoranizi, and thank God they were there. I checked the list more then once, and looked on other websites to confirm it, until I found some articles confirming Del Piero and Totti absence from the “Mondial”. I didn’t understand how they could do this!! How could Lippi do this? Well, it’s true he is 35 years old, and in the world of football it considered very old; but he still plays and scores in his club, and he is irreplaceable!! Now, I remember that I hated when older person use to say that such player or singer or any public personal from the past is irreplaceable or is the best. I think that they just like people from the time they was younger I thought I would never do that; I like new things and changes,  but it seems it’s just a human nature. ... Still, Del Piero is irreplaceable! :P\n",

And sometimes we have pancake or Arabic meals like fool, Hummus, taamiaah. In lunch the main food is rice, we eat it around everyday. We have heavy meals with it like chicken, meat, fish, soap.. etc. There are many ways to make chicken for example, and every method make a new meal. So, we have a lot of choices. We also eat Italian food, Chinese food, Indian food... And there are traditional or Arabic meals like mantoo, mahshii,samboosa,shawirma... Saudi Arabia is famous of its Kabsa. It's meat and rice. We make these food at home and sometimes we order from restaurants. we have many famous restaurants like KFC, Pizza Hut, Chili's, Mcdonald's, Chucke Cheese. We don't eat pork meat or drink alcohol. Because we are Muslims and they are prohibited for us. Also, Saudi Arabia is famous of Arabic coffee. When guests come to our houses we serve it to them first. We usually don't use forks or knives to eat lunch, we just use spoons and sometimes bread. Some people eat on the table, and another sit on the floor. About desserts, Syria is famous of it. It makes very delicious desserts. I like baqlawah much. Dates here are very popular especially in the holy month of Ramadan. We eat it with breakfast.

When Falcon finished from break its beak, it waits till its new beak  grows again. It then broke it claws as well. After growing its claws, Falcon starts plucking its old feathers. After five months, the Falcon starts to fly in its new trip as it born again. Falcons live after this change another 30 years. Why do you need to change? In many times, we need to undergo to change if we want to adapt to  the reality. I know that the process of change may force us to get ride of old  memories and inherent and bad traditions. Our freedom from the burdens of the past (what is negative) is only the way to take advantage of our present and planning fro our future.\n",
      "textContent--->Beyond The Words There is always a \"TRUTH\" behind \"I'AM JUST KIDDING\", a little \"EMOTION\" behind \"I DUN CARE\", a little \"PAIN\" behind \"IT'S OKAY\", a little \"I NEED YOU\" behind \"LEAVE ME ALONE\" and a lot of \"WORDS\" behind \"THE SILENCE\"...!!!! This is one of the best sayings I've ever heard. It's like a common secret that everybody feels but nobody reveals. Sometimes, people use \"I'm just kidding\" as an excuse when the other side gets mad at them for saying something. I mean people often use this when they insult someone; and to make it's effect lighter, they would says \"I'm just kidding\" -- like this is supposed to make them feel better about it. People say \"I don't care\" day and night. And to be honest, I think sometimes it's emotionless at the time it is said, but when this thing actually happens, the emotions start to climb to the surface. For example, person A and B have been fighting for a while. This is the last bit of their conversation: A: I DUN CARE if you were run over by a truck or hit by a drunk driver. B: I DUN CARE if you were stabbed or kidnapped. You see, it's completely impossible that there wouldn't be any emotions if some of the horrible actions that they wished for the other partner came true. I think that's what urges some suicidal thoughts in some people against whom \"I DUN CARE ABOUT YOU ANY MORE\" has been used. They would like to test the credibility of this sentence. Again, sometimes -- I have to use sometimes a lot because generalizing my point of view would be unrealistic --, one says \"leave me alone\" and waits for insistence from the other person to stay. Maybe one wants to make sure that the issue really matters to the other person and that they truly want to bring some happiness -- or in other cases, find solutions -- to get things back on the track. Finally, \"THE SILENCE\" itself is a behaviour. One could talk for hours and convey nothing to the other person while they could have saved their breath and silenced to convey their meaning in a glimpse. A funny Egyptian story about silence, it's a proverb actually but there is a story that lies behind it. \"Silence is a sign of satisfaction\". When a suitor comes to the bride's father to propose to the daughter, later on, the father would go to the girl and asks her whether she accepts the man as her husband or not. If she was silence, this means she accepts him but she is too shy to say yes. The story is very old I think because no one uses this technique any more. But we use the proverb in another mean way. It is used when a person is just being polite -- or timid -- by not refusing doing something others ask him to, so he gets silent, and people would say \"silence is a sign of satisfaction\" when it's very apparent that this person don't want to do it.

      "textContent--->Is it the End of the World ? Hi I haven't write any entry for more than a month. Actually I wasn't really busy but you can say I was mentally busy ! Many things happened since the beginning of the 2011, This year seems hiding many events and surprises for us. Many people start talking about the end of the world in 2012. I don't personally believe in﻿ the 2012 phenomenon but also I don't deny that the end of the world is soon and what is happening now is a clear sign for that Ending. There's been a lot of strange things happening recently. Revolutions, Tsunamis, Global Worming, Earthquakes all of these events haven't happened before in such a short time. Some people don't agree with me and say that nothing new in this world. Wars and natural disasters happened before but the open media plays a big role to present the world as this madness. By looking at the calender. I can't believe that we are still in March. My last entry was in at the end of January and it was about the uprisings in the Middle East. When I wrote that entry it was the beginning of Egyptian revolution. In only one month. The revolution succeeded an it spreads across many Arabs countries. I can't believe how all of these things happened in only one month ! Many things we used to be for decades change in only few days. The idea that any change needs time isn't necessarily true ! Many people here are worried and have concerns about the future, Whether these revolution would make better future or to more struggles and corruptions. Many people are concerned that these peaceful protests may lead -in the worst case- to a civil war or to many victims before it reach its goals like what is happening now in Libya. Every thing around me talking about politics. New Breaking news coming in every minute. Social network transformed to be political websites. Even In my college every one speaks about what is happening now. you can hear different opinions and negotiations which is never happened before. Far from Politics to Japan, The massive earthquake and Tsunami was really scary. I feel bad for this disaster. I know that some natural disaster are out of control but the number of victims was high, and the nuclear leak make the whole world concerned and rethink about the safety of using nuclear power. Future seems like a fog to me I can't predict what will happened next week rather than in few months or years but I dream for a better future and peace every where.\n",

Look at Ibn Battuta as a man of exceptional genius in narrative literature, came out in his adventures to distant lands and explore the unknown in his travels around the world an exciting story to tell us which reflects the great cultures of many peoples in the world of his time. Due to what is stated in the manuscript of Ibn Battuta famous, considered by Eastern and Western intellectuals, both as a man with open eyes to the world. And Ibn Battuta is an example of the greatness of the exploration Arab in the past, a figure not only represents his hometown of Tangier, country Morocco, but generally represents the Arab and Islamic world in the literature of the journey the world can be proud of its Arab and Islamic world to the feet of mankind important information about the world. But despite the impressive global character of Ibn Battuta, including his literary text, photo, does not negate the possibility of offering the hypothesis, which says that perhaps you might imagine stories of his travels or transported to San others based on the literature of its predecessors, and information collected without the notes to her or to her, if you I can travel back in Time, I wanted to be in the era of Ibn Battuta, so explore with him and who know what lured in some countries, and what the incentive paid to travel and write about those countries .. In my personal view is of the greatest Arab who tried to indicate in the culture of other peoples ..\n",
      "textContent--->Beautiful Songs Remember the English course I'm having? In this course, the professor makes us listen to a song and try to guess the lyrics. He had chosen two wonderful songs, each of which made it very hard for me to suppress my tears. I'm sure that they are old enough for all native speakers to be already familiar with it. I love the quiet songs that at some point don't become quiet any more but they make you feel the greatness of the moment. You know at the end of a movie when they use some song when the champion receives a medal or when the miracle finally happens. This is the kind of songs I like. But I don't know what this type of music is called, so could you please listen to the next songs -- the ones we listened to in the course -- and tell me what's the type of the music in there? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d2_tNxBxhY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPCfdzyRJus\n",

After reaching four books, the actions of the characters in their books become very predictable to me. This is what annoys me. I can't enjoy a whole series of books written by a specific author. Once I get used to the style, I have to start the hunt for another good author that their work interests me, and believe me, this last condition limits the possible options, if there are any. It's very annoying not to be able to follow a whole series to the end, but at the same time, it's a blessing because I get exposed to many ways of thinking as well as a variety of experiences.\n",

Fred thought about making this paper about transferring mails around the world in short time that doesn't exceed two days. His professor saw that this is an infeasible idea and that people wouldn't need something like that. He got a C or a D for that project, of that I'm not sure. His professor promised to give him a high grade only if he changed the idea of his paper to a more feasible one. To that he replied, \"You keep your grade and I'll keep my dream.\" When Fred finished college, he started bringing his idea into real life. He started with eight mails, lost some money at the beginning, made a complete joke out of himself but he fought for it and in the end he made his company the biggest one in the field.

In addition, it is known as the pearl of Mediterreanean. Alexandria has a very great heritage which distance it from the rest of the country although it is only 225km from Cairo. It is called Alexandria according to Alexander The Great who found it in 331 BC. Alexandria is famous for its costal weather which makes it wonderful all the time especially in summer. Alexandria is regarded as one of the most crucial source of tourism and national income. This is because of its great sights and its great location. Alex has many different beautiful and charming areas sush as Mamoura, Montaza, and Agamy. These areas are full of attractive sights espescially El Mamoura. Last weak I traveled to it and I spent nonforgotable four days. I enjoyed everything there the weather, the sea, and everything. Even the people there are very kind and helpful. But to tell you the truth I get bothered because I had to pay money to enter the beach. I got bothered because I am persuaded that the owner of everything is our God, and God allow us to enjoy the nature freely without any limitations or money. I am persuaded that nature is for all,  the poor,  and the rich. there is also somthing wich annoyed me, I found that the main beach is devided into a beach for the local people, and a beach for the high class people. This makes me feel inferior to these people of the private beach. It is unfair to devide the nature according to the people classes. It is very painfull to realize that God gave us everything but the people can do anything to deprive the others from these godly gifts just to collect money as best as they can. Really, from the bottom of my heart I say what a pity.\n",

They have a lot of technologies ,models and sizes . They are used by seniors ,young people and children . In my opinion ,mobiles help us in many cases but they also cause a lot of health problems . Even with that problems we still use them . However , they make our life easier and they can help us to be in touch with our friends ,family and also with our job. Sometimes they disturb us especially when we are study or work. I think mobiles are the best invention in the world . they help us to be safety .

I have my dream to complete my education and I have beautiful life with my family. The first challenge in my life was my education, yet I was stronger than it. I was new student in the university,and I though I would not complete my study,because it was so difficult. However,I was wrong. I have got a bachelor's degree;moreover,I received high marks. Also, while I was studying at university,I had a big dream which is getting a scholarship to study abroad,so that I could get my master's degree. Although my dream was very difficult,I did it. Now I will stay in Canada,until I will finish my program . The second challenge in my life is my family. In my own country I had very conformable life ,whereas my life in Canada is tired. For example,I used when I return from school to find everything ready for me such as my clothes , my food and my room as well. In contrast to my life now it is very hard because everything I have do it by my self. Furthermore,Before my travel I had a lot of free time spent with my family and my friends, but now I do not have time to do I cook my lunch.

And five or six months ago, the iPhone4 started to compete it. Most students in the university have BlackBerry, you can see it everywhere. People who have BlackBerry waste their whole time using its chatting service. They don't move their eyes from it, and once they start a chat , they lose their sense of everything around them. I just wondering, don't they get bored chatting all the time?!! About those who have the  iPhone, they spend their time using its applications. It's something like and addiction, as soon as they get one of these devices, they become addicts –especially, BlackBerry users- Actually, I'm seeing my older brother, he can't spend an only hour without using his iPhone!! In the university, I noticed that some of those students try to show the others that they have an iPhone4 or a BlackBerry. They hang it around their necks. So, it can be reachable, and at the same time all people can see what they have. Some have both of them, and they carry them at the same time. I can't understand why do they think like this silly way!! I repeat that I refer to some users not the all. I'm talking about my city, I don't know if the same thing is happening in another countries. But one of my Colombian friends told me that they also have this fashion in Colombia. About me, I'm really satisfied with my Nokia mobile. It's still new, why I'd replace it with another mobile?! http://www.safeshare.tv/v/ZfdXud-Kzys In this link you can watch a funny video shows the competition between these two companies.

I am totally exhausted emotionally and psychologically after reading this book,I don't think I'll ever....... EVER forget this masterpiece for that matter. The content shocked me,the writing and delivery left me in awe. \"Forbidden\" by Tabitha Suzuma is a novel about a brother and sister who try to raise their three other siblings and pick up the pieces from their abandoned father and alky mother that leaves them to fend everything in this dark world by themselves,By the time they have become much more than brother and sister ,they have fallen in love with each other,a love that can never be allowed. I believe this book is the most controversial issue ,but also one of the most ballsy,powerful and emotionally charged YA novel that I have ever read ,it made me think ,feel ,ask:How can something that feels so wrong, be so wrong, feel so right?! Even though it was amazing but I find it hard to recommended due to the taboo subject matter. But it's definitely a book that you have to decide for yourself. Anyways,beyond absorbing,memorizing and breathtakingly brilliant:FORBIDDEN was quite the unforgettable experience.

      "textContent--->I'm on my own now I've been translating stories from Arabic to English since I got here . I translated stories that I loved and thought they were inspiring to me and I wanted to share them with others. But it didn't really tell me if I'm a good writer or not. Learning a new language and being a good writer in this language are completely two different things. Learning a new language isn't so hard. With memorizing a lot of vocabulary, memorizing idioms and learning grammar rules; it becomes handy. While writing in this language is a whole new level which requires seriousness, determination and a lot of reading and writing. I know it's not going to be easy, and it's going to take more time. But I need to know if I can write or not. Translating my thoughts is a lot harder than translating a written article. But why don't I give it a try? I might translate some stories from time to time, if I found some good ones. I might write a story by myself. No, just kidding! I can't write stories, it's very advanced for me. I don't think that my writings are going to be great, because I'm not going to push myself to write something that isn't me. So, whether you think it's trivial or brilliant, it's going to be the real me. I might express my feeling, my perspective or write about trivial things (when I don't find anything to write about). The point is that I want to keep writing even if I don't have a good topic to talk about. Writing about trivial things might not help me very much with learning to write impressive phrases, but it will definitely help me with vocabulary and grammar. So the bottom line is that: I'm trying to express, and not to impress. Wish me luck!\n",

We have many davantages and disadvantages for having cars. First of all, you can finish your things in the short time by cars. For example If you want to buy something like food, or clothes you will go shopping buy your cars in the short time. Also if you have emergency problem, like someone sick you will take that person to a hospital in the short time. Furthermore, it's easy to travel to other citise by cars. For example, If you travel to other city by your car, you can go to any places you want. However, If you travel by bus, the bus driver has station his will stop in it, then you should take anothe kinds of transport. On the other hand, cars have disadvantage like air pollution. For example too much cars in the street. When people walk beside the street they will smell the carbon coming from the car, then they will get sick after long time. Also cars make people lazy. Many people stop doing sport after they having a car, so we should try to do soprt even we have a car. To sum up, cars have many advantages and disadvantges. However, we should use a car in the good way. Also we should not use a car always try to use anothe kinds of transport to make decrease for the air pollution.\n",
      "textContent--->The Impossible is nothing In one of the universities in Colombia, one of the students attended a math lecture. He sat in the back of the hall and slept quietly. At the end of the lecture, he wake up on the students voices leaving the hall. Before leaving, he noticed that the professor has written two mathematical problems on the white board. So he wrote them down in his notebook and left the hall. When he came back home, he started solving those problems. They were very hard. So he went to the university's library, picked up some references and started working them out again. After 4 days, he was able to solve the first problem but he was feeling very angry with his professor for giving them such a hard assignment. In the next lecture, the professor didn't ask about the assignment, he was very surprised about that. So he went up to the professor and told him that the first problem took him 4 days and 4 pages to solve it. The professor was very surprised, he told the student that he didn't give any assignments. \"Those 2 problems that I wrote on the white board, was an example of the mathematical problems which the greatest scientist couldn't work out at all. \" The professor explained. The negative contentment is what stopped scientists from solving this problem. So if this student was awake while the professor was telling them that solving this problem is impossible, he wouldn't be able to solve it. So I guess sleeping in the lecture worked for him that time, but don't try it though. He explained to his professor how and why he solved this problem. The solution of this problem with it's 4 pages, is still exhibited there in this university. When I first heard this expression, \"The Impossible is nothing\" . I couldn't understand it nor believe it. But this story proves the credibility of this statement. It's just the negative contentment which makes us believe that the impossible exists but the reality proved that it's all nonsense.\n",

I can’t believe that the talk about the destruction of Al-Aqsa in  the Zionism press became so badly that actually knows that the temperature of blood and jealousy of religion had been discontinued in the veins of people. When I heard that AL- Aqsa will destroyed I cried and my heart burned from the severity of pain and I wondered how long  will we stay in our place without doing any thing. Are the Jews having a heart? The answer is no because how can they have a heart and  they kill the child, women and destroy the Palestine houses. More children lost their parents or lost one of them. Are any one accepting on what happen now in Palestine? For any one Muslim or Christian if your family is destroyed  and you became alone in the world what will you do? The things which will happen to you actually happen now to the people in Palestine. I think, you will do more and more or you will do as you can to do. So why not start moving a correct step to forward? When we start moving step by step we will save the entire world  from the Jews. I can’t know how can you play, eat and drink and AL-Aqsa in  dangerous. You are happy in your home around your family and  in this moment there are more people crying and around the rocket  and filberts . Every one of them try to save his family and found  a peaceful place and you watch TV or go to club or …. Al-Aqsa Mosque is in our hands now but we don’t know  what will happen after this time so we must move now to do  any thing will save the Aqsa from the cursed and retarded Jews who claim that  Al-Aqua mosque for them. They know that they are liar and impostor. Finally, I don’t tell every thing in my heart. I have more and more to say but not saying will enough. we must say and do in the same time. I hope from all people to do any thing they can do and  put their selves in Palestine. And if Palestine is your country  and all these events happen in it what will you do to save it from Jews.\n",

      "textContent--->Diagnosed of being easily impressed Today, I was reviewing my previous entries and my comments. I realized that I'm that kind of people who are easily impressed. I find lots of things fascinating. I'm moved by very simple things and other people might not even have a second look at. For instance, I started watching Indian movies about a month ago. I have some friends who are crazy about this genre. I, on the other hand, didn't have much time to watch any. When I had the time, I brought about six Indian movies to watch. The first movie I watched, made me cry for two hours like a five year old who lost her doll. You think the second one was different? Not at all. The six movies have the same basic idea. Actually all the Indian movies have the same basic idea. However, I continued crying during the rest five and each one of them impressed me even more. Indian movies are like clay that you can shape into many different shapes but they're all still made of clay. The shape is what impresses me, and not the clay itself. This concept might be a bit ambiguous for those who haven't been in such situation. So, how bad is it?\n",

But when I rescued you, you wrote on a rock?\" He answered: \"When anybody hurts you, you should write on the sand, so the wind of forgiveness will erase the pain.

For me,  my father is only a source of money. When I was a child, I used to see  my friends kissing and hugging their fathers infront of me. At the beginning, it was an ordinary thing, but after I grew up, I felt that I have missed a great something which is my father`s affection, I realized that I didn`t take anything from my father except for his money. In addition, I realized that we not only need money to live, but we need love and affection as well. After my mother`s death I thought that my father would change to the better and he would play my mother`s role but unfortunatly he couldnot do that. I am hardly trying to live until I find the one who will make me up. Inspite of that, I love  my father so much but, if I had had the capacity to choose my father, I wouldn`t have choosen him. Finally, to each father, please! be a real, good, and kind father, give your children the love they need and the protection they want. Don`t spend most of your time working becaue you believe that your children need money, of course they do,  but be aware that they need love before anything else.\n",

I check new corrections for my entries and new Arabic entries needing corrections, if there were any. I usually write an entry everyday, but sometimes, I can't think of anything to write about. So, I just keep the web page open, and stare at it waiting for inspiration. It does come, sometimes. A few years ago, I asked one of my friends about a website where I can find some good non-Egyptians. I wanted to come out of the shell and start knowing about people from other countries, and how they think. She had no suggestions. And now, when I found this website, I said, \"This is what I'm looking for. A website that encourages exchanging cultures, thoughts and making some good friends.\" The people here are extremely nice, patient and helpful. The only thing that I don't like is that the Arabic learners is being a bit lazy ,lately. Every other language is getting like tons of entries every couple of minutes, but the Arabic section is so extinct. I wish if the Arabic learners become more active. Finally, I want to thank the geniuses who made this website. And special thank you to everyone who helped me with their corrections, or encouraged me with a nice comment. I really appreciate it all.

Muslims visit each other and say (salam alikm) mean hi for their family and friends. In the culture of Kuwait the old people in the family give for the young people money to make them happy.

      "textContent--->Analyze This, Analyze That It was about four years ago -- or maybe more, I'm not sure -- when I started having these symptoms. I consulted a friend of mine and found that she had the same symptoms. It seemed a bit scary at that time, and maybe I still feel the same way about it. I'm not going to keep you waiting any longer. The problem was that I was always tempted to analyze anything and everything. I know, it seems very ridiculous. I just found it amusing to think about reasons and analyzing things and coming to satisfying conclusions (which were rarely met). I could watch a bird or an ant and observe it's every move, then imagine the reason for doing each of these moves or a some kind of scenario like a movie. Unfortunately, I don't know how to use this precious gift in solving my academic problems quickly. I mean, I could stare at a code for hours and still don't have the slightest idea of how to solve the problem. So, this only works with the surroundings in practical life. You know, one benefit of it is that during the \"light\" traffic in the morning -- that's why it takes me and hour to get to college while I could get there in 15 minutes if it wasn't for that \"light\" traffic -- I could look out of the window and just analyze the things in the street until I get there. And believe me, if you're in Egypt, then you will find lots and lots of things in the Egyptian street that you can analyze. I'd better not get started about this traffic thing because if I did, no one will be able to stop me. Those who had been to Egypt will know exactly what I mean.\n",

      "textContent--->From A Son To His Father One day, the father came home late from work. And as usual he was so exhausted. He found his son waiting for him at the door. \"Dad, can I ask you a question?\" The son said. \"Sure, go ahead,\" the father replied. \"How much do you earn in one hour, dad?\" the boy asked while staring at his father. \"This is non of your business. Why are you asking such a silly question?\" The father said sternly. \"I just want to know. Dad please, tell me how much you earn in an hour?\" the boy begged. \"If you insist, I get 30 dollars per hour,\" the father said rather impatiently. \"Dad, could you lend me 10 dollars,\" he said politely. \"So you wanted to know how much I earned, so you can have 10 dollars and spend it on your silly dolls. Go to your room and sleep. I have been having a hard time in work, and I don't have time for this nonsense.\" The father shouted. The boy didn't say a word and he went up to his room, immediately. After a little while, the father felt that he had been hard on his boy, and maybe he really needed the 10 dollars. So, he followed him to his room. And when he opened the door, he said, \"Are you asleep?\" \"No dad I'm awake,\" the boy said in a low voice. \"I'm sorry that I had been hard on you,\" the father said shamefully. \" I just had a long, bad day today. Here is the 10 dollars that you wanted.\" His son became very happy. For the father's surprise, the boy pulled some money from under his pillow and put it with the 10 dollars that he had just got. The father became furious, \"Why did you ask for money, if you already have some!\" He asked. \"I didn't have enough money, but now I have 30 dollars. Can I buy an hour of your time to spend together?!\" The boy asked innocently. Now, I don't know if this story is true or not, but I bet that many parents know so little about their children. I have noticed that many people use nannies, which soon becomes a replacement of parents, whether they believed it or not. In Egypt, we don't have this nanny thing at all, at least, nothing that I can tell. But, I've seen some American movies, not very much, but enough to know that nannies are widely used. I mean, are they sure that they want their child to be raised by a nanny, god knows who she is or what she is going to teach their child? Children are like cameras that capture everything that happens around them. Every incident -- no matter how small it is -- will build something in the child's personality. They need special care and attention which they can never get from a nanny. The child needs protection, not only to keep them physically safe, but also keep them from gaining bad attitude. Along with protection, they need affection which can never be given to them by any nanny in the world but their mother. I seriously don't know how these mothers bear to leave their children with someone they don't know, but they must have got a strong heart to do that!\n",

He asked each minister to take the bag and go to the palace garden  and fills the bag with the good things from various fruits and crops. Also he asked them not to seek the help of anyone in this task and not make another person do this task. The three ministers surprised from the request of the King and each one of them take his bag and go to garden. first minister keen to satisfy the king. He gathered all the best fruits  and finest crops. Also he selected the good and nice fruit till he was filling up the bag. The second minister was convinced that the king does not want the fruit, he does not need them for himself and he wouldn't examine  the fruit. Because all of these the minster collected the fruits with  negligence and he didn't investigate the good from the bad from fruit till he was filling up the bag as they are agreed. The third minister did not believe that the King will be interested in the content of the bag so he already filled the bag with grasses, herbs and leaves of trees. The next day the king ordered to bring the ministers with their three  bags which they collected. When the ministers met the king, the king ordered the soldiers to take the three ministers and imprison each one of them separately with his bag which he collected for three months in remote prison and no one  can reach to them. Also the king was ordered to prevent eating and  drinking for them. The first minister still eats from the good fruit which he collected until the three months have elapsed. The second minister had lived three months in a tight and lack of power, relying on the good fruit which he collected. The third minister died from hunger before the end the first month. Ask yourself from any type are you? You are now in the garden of the world. You are free to combine the good works or malicious actions, but tomorrow when The king of kings order to be incarcerated in your grave alone at this dark and narrow prison. What do you think will benefit you other than the good works which you collected in your world? Summary: Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Always be on the pool of good works on the ground to comfort in end  with things which your hand collected in life. Because later remorse does not benefit\n",
      "textContent--->Don't talk to strangers !! Like most kids I was always told \"don't talk to strangers\" WHY? My parents never gave me particularly relevant details on this issue. It is one rule that almost everyone learns as a child. But I filled in my own blanks from stories other kids told me about alien kidnappings, goblins, kids’ slavery, and three crazy ladies who would lock you in a basement... (Kids’ Imaginations). We all know it's a big bad world out there. Every day the newspapers are filled with toxic stories of killing, and abusing. Parents worry about letting their children out of their sight. But you can't always protect your children from every possible danger. Another point that parents should keep in mind is that children do not necessarily have to leave their homes to be mistreated. But when you get older, being able to draw near someone you don’t know and start a conversation becomes a good skill to have. Talking to strangers makes you a social, outgoing person, may be friendly; but some adults still don’t like the idea of talking to strangers (I am one of them). If you aren’t in the mood to talk, it can be annoying if a stranger comes up to you and tries start a conversation with you . sometimes can be very awkward. Well I am sort of ……………..(can anyone out there help me find out the right word ?  ). When I am on a plane or the bus or whatever, I do not want people to talk to me.

I have a difficulty to cite just one type of music or one color! I just love things when they are mixed and various. I have favorite color, but I  think it became hideous if I wear every things in one color, and the color that I like on my cloths, I don't like it for wall paint. So when I subscribe on a website, I don't fill those case that define my favorite music or anything else. But one of my friends told me once that I have to had a favorite music or a favorite song, and gave me a long lecture on how a person know his \"favorite\" song. I tried to do so, and I listened to some songs that I like. And decided that my favorite is a Zucchero song : cosi celeste. First it's in Italian; and I love Italian, I think it's a very beautiful language. It's a have a rock beats, and I like that kind of rock music the three voices are : a rock voice (Zucchero)which make any song good. an Algerian voice :)), and  Mami voice  I think is exceptional  and a black voice! Here is the song, I hope you like it. I like it, I'm not sure if I should say is my favorite thought :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIXHFBX6TZw&feature=related\n",

I feel so exhausted but I cannot sleep because If I slept then when I wake up, I'll have to start studying again or going to college. Watching a movie is like the fun pause between two busy periods. Yesterday, I watched a movie called The Expendables. It's an action movie. It didn't wow me really, not like Inception anyway, because its story wasn't strong or strange enough. It was very plain and straight forward. The ending was great, though. Jason Statham recited a piece of poetry that made it a funny ending. There is only one line I didn't understand. What is the \"Epidemy of Cool\"? Here is ending. Enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkLxp9CwyUQ\n",

Of course, there are other European languages that are neither Latin nor Germanic, like Irish (or celtic), Russian, ... But for the Greek I can't understand why is it so different from Latin!\n",

No. It is that pride that pushes you to believe in yourself since you are on the right path. That pride that makes you go ahead merely for there are no reasons to stop.

      "textContent--->Phobias Phobias are not just extreme fears. they are irrational fears. They can affect on people live and make them frightened to do things  which most people do without thinking . for example, if you have a fear of heights, you may derive 50 km to avoid a high bridge. I have a phobia from mouse. I can't stand to see a mouse running near  to me. When I see a mouse I cry for half hour approximately. One day my friends saw me cry from mouse they laughed from my  reaction when I saw the mouse. My family also laughed on me when I see a mouse. I don't know why they don't know what happen to me in this moment. I feel that the mouse will kill me or do a dangerous thing to me. I try to be more quite when I see a mouse but till this moment I can't. But I still try. There are more types from phobia. The most popular type is exams phobia I think that. It doesn't matter how clever you are or how hard you work, you have  probably felt worried before an exam at some time in the past. experts believe that about 50 percent of all students suffer from exam  phobia. some people are so frightened of an exam they are going to take that they can't remember information when they are in the exam  room. These students will probably get lower marks. Some students  cannot even go into the exam room, and of course, the fail. Exams are extremely important for all students . they afraid of failing, because if they fail  they will not find a good job. Also, students don't want to disappoint their parents. So what can they do if they suffer from exam phobia? i will write about treatments for phobias but firstly I will read about it. There are different reasons for this phobia.\n",

      "textContent--->control your anger There was a child who is difficult to please him. His father gave him a bag full of nails and he told him “knock one tail in the garden fence every time you lost your temper  or discord with anyone.” On the first day the boy knocked approximately 37 nail in the fence  of the garden. The following week the child learn how he can control his anger and  the number of nails which he knocked daily became decline. He discovered that controlling in him self is easier than knocking  the nails in the fence. Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t knock a nail in the fence  then he went to his father to tell him that  he had no longer need to  knock a nail. His father said to him “now, remove one nail for each day passing without losing your temper.” After several days, the child told his father that he pulled off all the nails from the fence. The father took his son to the fence and said to him “well done my son but look at the holes which the nails left in the fence, the fence will never return again as it was.” Finally, When you argument or disagreement with the other and you got out  some bad words, you leave them with a big hurt in their hearts such as the holes which you see in this story. You can stab a person then withdraw the knife from his throat but  after you have left the trace of an open wound. So this doesn’t matter how many times you regretted to him because the wound is till there. Wounded of tongue is stronger than the wounded of body.\n",

      "textContent--->Bad Friends ^  ^ by Claire Seeber \t Bad Friends is an absorbing suspense novel that will keep you wondering what might happen up until the very last few pages. The plot is about a 30-year-old TV producer Maggie Warren is involved in a tragic coach crash,However, the crash affected her memory and she only has flimsy flashbacks of what happened before the accident. She also cannot recall why she split up with the love of her life, Alex, nor the reason why her boss is blackmailing her,and yet a young woman called Fay turns up claiming that Maggie saved her life,which she doesn't recognise at all. Things started to go wrong for Maggie when she starts getting anonymous phone calls and texts, her personal things go missing, grafitti is sprayed all over her flat and she keep receiving bouquets of lilies – with messages of condolences. When I started reading this book, the plot felt a little too busy and complex, but on reflection, all of the strands were necessary in order to build the tension. The pace and suspense build well so that by the end you are well and truly hooked. ;)  What I did like about this book was the growth of Maggie, from someone I really disliked to someone I could feel empathy for. I went from thinking she was a skin-deep,self-absorbed and completely bored ,to really thinking she had had a rough ride and rooting for her. Bad Friends is a pretty easy-peasy read. At just under 400 pages. so read it and enjoy ...... happy reading\n",

      "textContent--->A nother time and a nother place. Yesterday, I imagined myself at a nother time and in a nother place so, I was very happy. Therefore, If I had the capacity to change my time and my place, I would like to live in Makka at the time of the prophet \"Mohamed\". It was a great time which was full of love, tolerance and power, at this time you can easily find the features of the perfect model who anyone wants to follow. ATthis time I found that everyone loved the other for the sake of love not  for the sake of anything else, everyone was ready to sacrifice himself to remain the other alive and safe. In addition,poeple worked together to achieve many progresses to make their country more advanced. When I choosed this time and this place specificly I choosed them  because there was a leader who ruled the poeple by justice and love. This leader is the prophet\" Mohamed\"who had a message for those poeple to deliver. He was trying all the time to abolish slavery trade and set the slavers free. and he spread peace among the poeple. From my point of view \"Prophet Mohamed\" is the most intelligent leader at this time because he saw that if he wanted to build a country he had to  establish the poeple first before doing anything else. As a result,his age is in history and his strategies are taught in colleges now. How far he was a great leader and father at the same time and I am so proud of him because he inculcated values and ethics in poeples` minds and souls. Becauce of all of these things I would like to live at this time and just see the peron who changed the world for the better and made us better creatures. Without exaggeration\"Mohamed\"is the teacher of teachers.\n",

This time my trip was only for two days, so the plane was the best or only choice. I forgot how the airport can be interesting. A great variety of people, not only from the country but also from around the world! The flight was internal, and yet there were many foreigners. It was funny; one rarely hears an Arabic word or even French! Some speak strange languages I do not know. I only speak French and English, but I can recognize Italian, Spanish, German and Russian. There was a group of people,who took the same flight as me, speaks a language I could not even guess! Then I thought it was probably Norwegian;I know there are Norwegian companies in our region, oil companies. The largest group was an Asian group; it was so big that when they stood at the gate, it was believed that the aircraft was headed towards the Far East. While it was headed towards Oran, a city in western Algeria. There was just some non-Asian on that flight!\n",

      "textContent--->Catch a cold this week, Take an exam next week From the beginning of winter, I've been waiting for the cold to come. To me, whenever the winter comes, catching a cold becomes inevitable. In Egypt, winter has started about a month ago and I was getting really suspicious because I didn't catch anything although all my friends caught everything you can imagine. I was starting to believe that I was under a hex or something. But then, I had a sore throat yesterday (which is my worst nightmare). I thought it was a visit (from a NOT dear old friend) that will take only one day. Today, I realized that this friend decided to continue the journey until the life cycle ends. This visitor love fooling around, I'm telling you. Here is the proof. The life cycle is like this: 1) First day: I have a sore throat. 2) Second day in the morning: A pain in the right ear join in. 3) Second day in the night: My left ear hurts too. 4) Third day: I start talking like Pinocchio, nose problem (believe me, you don't want to know the details). 5) Fourth day: I could act like a vampire (because of the red eyes), a heater (seriously, they don't need to turn on the heater. They just need to set beside me and they'll get loads of heat and catch a cold which well make them self-sufficient because later they'll generate the heat by themselves) or I could simply play dead (which is the easiest and the least painful one of them all). See what I'm talking about. This is my annual excruciating visit that I have to live with. It's okay to catch cold, it was expected anyway, but the problem is that my final exams are next week. Perfect timing, right? All right, I'm going to lead myself out of this website right now before anyone gets infected with the virus or an unpleasant visit from you-know-who.\n",
      "textContent--->The Egyptian Revolution What happened here in Egypt for the last two weeks is something that will never be forgotten. I've been thinking about which aspect I should write about first. So many things happened in the last 2 weeks so I can only write about abstractions of this incident. It all started on the 25th of January. A week before that day, people sent invitations to others on Facebook asking them to join this demonstration. This demonstration was simply for demanding a decent life for all the Egyptian people that includes: fighting unemployment, eliminating corruption elements in the current system and defining a reasonable salary that satisfies basic needs. The main sign that was held that day was ¨Freedom... Democracy... Social Justice¨. There's nothing wrong with that, right?... Wrong! At least that's the government's opinion. The government started suppressing the demonstrators. They started using their one and only tool they have for dealing with any demonstration which is violence. In the night of that day, invitations of making the next Friday 28th of January \"The Day of Anger\". Invitations on Facebook were sent by everyone to everyone. They planned to make it a \"Million March\". They planned to march form everywhere and asking people that look out of balconies and windows to get down and march with them, then they were to meet in Tahrir Square. Also, the bar was raised as they found no response or respect from the government side. People started raising signs that asks for more than just ¨Freedom... Democracy... Social Justice¨, they cheered ¨The people wanted to overthrow the regime¨. As always, the police followed their traditional method. They tried to stop people from reaching Tahrir Square because all the demonstrators from all the streets tried to reach this square. They thought that ¨Divide And Conquer¨ will work this time but they underestimated the people's rage. They exhausted everything they have: tear gas, powerful sprinklers of water, rubber bullets and real bullets. They used it all until there was nothing left. Many people died that day, hundreds hurt and hundreds arrested. Around six o'clock, the police in the field  received a command to leave the field and save their own lives specially that the army was to get down to the streets and curfew was imposed from 7:00 pm until 8:00 am. That day, was the beginning of the disaster. A disastrous plan was being executed by foreigners (whom we still don't know but the government does) on our land, so here is what happened. All police stations were burnt down, all prisons were bombed and about thirty thousand (30,000) prisoner were let out. All this happened simultaneously (coincidence?! I don't think so). You can't imagine how bad this was. Large hypermarkets and Malls were robbed like Carrefour and others, over twenty-one thousand (21,000) -- or even more -- piece of weapon were stolen and were in the hands of these prisoner. These foreigners went pointing their guns on the face of all civilians, robbing homes, smashing every shop they encounter in the way, attacking the Egyptian Museum, crashing ATM's and steeling money from it. Can you imagine how dangerous this was? But then came back the Egyptian spirit that was long lost in this modern world. The simple Egyptian people really saved the day. I'll tell you how this happened in my next journal because I think no one will have the patience to read all this in one time. I'm sorry that this journal was not a happy one but I promise next one will be much better. By the way, thanks to all my friends who missed me during this time. You're the best friends I could have :)\n",

      "textContent--->Ancient Navigation In The Arabian Gulf  Since ancient, the Arabian Gulf has been very important to the Arabian Gulf countries. That because two thirds of its coasts are Arabian coasts. In the past they have depended much in this gulf in fishing, diving for pearls and in trading. So, it was one of the main pillars of their economic. Sailors used their simple boats to go fishing and diving. The equipments they used in diving and looking for pearls were very simple. About trading, they have exported some of their products such as, dates, grapes, wool, gum Arabic and gems to Indonesia, China and other far east countries. They have imported spices, perfumes and leathers from those countries. Their trading also has reached the east and the south of Africa. They have imported gold, perfumes and spices from there. Some of the problems and dangers they had are: sharks, harmful creatures. Plus, some skin and respiratory diseases because of diving. Now, in the presence of petrol in most of the Arabian Gulf countries those old professions naturally are not as important as they were before. ---------- What is the verb from \" ablution\" ??\n",
      "textContent--->Funny But Useful There were three men who travelled abroad for some reason. They couldn't find any good place to live in except for only one apartment in the twenty-seventh floor in a hotel. The receptionist there told them that the elevator closed it's doors automatically at 10 pm. So they had to be there before that time. If the elevator was closed, then it can't be opened until the next morning because the control room was very far from that building. In the first day, they went out and came back before it was 10. But in the next day, they came back running but it was 10:05 pm. The elevator was already shut five minutes ago. They almost cried, but it was all in vain. They decided to take the stairs instead. \"Let's have each one of us tell a story for 25 floors until we get to our room, so we wouldn't feel so tired,\" one of them suggested. The others liked the idea. So they started their journey to the top. The first man said, \"I'll tell you a bunch of jokes and funny stories that's going to make your stomach ache from laughing.\" And so he told them every joke he had in mind. They were laughing like crazy. The whole building was vibrating because of their laughter. Then it was the second man's turn. \"I'll tell you about a more serious stories,\" he said. He kept telling serious stories until the end of the second 25 floors. And then there was the third man who told them that they have heard jokes and serious stories, but the stories he was going to tell, would be very sad, miserable and grief stories. So he told them the most dreadful stories any one could ever hear. Then they finally arrived at the 75th floor, when a horrible fact hit them THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THE KEY OF THE ROOM WITH THE RECEPTIONIST! The receptionist was in the ground floor. When they realized this fact, they all fainted. The human life is mostly similar to this story. In the first 25 years, one tend to have fun, mess around and do fool things. They do not do anything useful in these best 25 years of their lives. While in the next 25 years, one get married, have kids of their own and be busy trying to make a living for their families until they reach the age of 50. In the last 25 years, the misery starts: one get sick, move between hospitals, spend money on medicines, divorce this, marry that, have problems between sons and their wives which requires fathers interference and debts accumulated which they borrowed for making their families happy, so neither they nor their families could be happy. Then death comes, and one wish to go back to the first 25 years. One should make sure that they always see the whole video tape of their lives running in front of their eyes, and have a goal to assess their behaviour. So when they deviate from the road which leads to their goal, they would find something that urges them to come back on the right track. I hope that this story would be helpful to others.\n",

Do you know that make someone feel smile it's called a charity, and it's written in your good deeds. I love making jokes. Some people feel comfortable when they accompany funny people because they don't have a hatred upon others. Some unexpected funny incidents can make me laugh. For example, I remember my sister was going to school when she was walking through the street, a dog was running and he saw my sister and then he started chasing her, My sister doesn't like dogs she get afraid from them. She was cursing the dog by saying\" Dog, you are an animal\"' We know that he is an animal-. This is one of the silly memories that I remember. Fine if I make you smile.\n",
      "textContent--->A Scary Fact About Learning Spanish Today, I read an article about how to learn Spanish. I was searching for a bit of motivation. Unfortunately, I found the exact opposite. It is true though. I've always believed in the fact that he stated, I just ignored it. What he said goes like this: \"Motivation for learning Spanish. Is this for you, or someone else? Your reason for learning has to be at least three years strong. To become conversational you need to recognize that you are embarking on a life long journey that needs at least three years to get off of its feet.\" Right now, my doubts are speaking loud and I'm questioning again whether I should go on with this. So far, I don't have any good reason for learning Spanish. I genuinely think that motivation is built based upon a solid ground which is constructed by a feasible and real reason. What do you I should do? The rest of the article: http://www.ehow.com/how_5431359_learn-spanish-alone.html\n",

But after a while I realized that during my 38 years of my living life, there were a few teachers who had inspired me impressively in a way and another, and they left an incredible affect on me as a teacher by their friendly personality, attitude, and knowledge they had. They knew in fact what they want to teach, how to teach it, and what is the easiest way to deliver the knowledge that they had. And I can say sincerely that you are one of them.

      "textContent--->Things in Life we can't change .. Is there something we can't change ? Can we change every thing in our life? I don't know how these questions came to my mind, well I was reading a personal development book, while I was reading I just realized how many things in my life should be organized and changed, and I was wondering if there are some things are parts of me and I can't change. My question now is more general I'm thinking of things people can't change whatever they do, work, or study, something they must live with it with no hope to change it. Things can be changeable or unchangeable, somethings are easy to change, others not but still changeable, people always change things they feel uncomfortable with,  hard to live with, or they dream to be, people live their life and work hard to make the change they want to see in their own life, their families life, or in their society. Thinking from simple things to hard things, we can change many things more than we expected we can change bad habits, educational level, our names, nationalities, how we look, our religion, other people, gender ... Thinking of thing we can't change is more difficult because when you think of something unchangeable you just find a way make it changeable even if this way is't easy, or maybe this thing can be changeable in the future, so I couldn't find many things, for example we can't change our genes, destiny, parents .. hmmm what else ? ~~~~~ This was a self talking I didn't find anything to write so I share these thoughts ( ^_^')    \n",

This essay will out line some of the important issues by focusing on hard problems and easy problems. First of all, hard problems may impact of many people . For example health problems sometimes the medicine can not address the disease.

My aunt hired a bus with its driver. Beside us, she invited my cousins and my other aunts. We were all 14, and we were women only. Makkah is only 78 Km from here –Jeddah. That takes about an hour by car. In the bus, and in our way to Makkah, mommy and  my aunt were examining our knowledgeability about the places we are going to. We reached Makkah around sundown. So, we prayed maghrib prayer (evening prayer) at the Holy Mosque. Then we visited the Exhibition of the Two Holy Mosques Architecture .

It showed a diversity of reactions from American people. You'll see all kinds of people: from bigots to the most sympathetic people. Some people were moved to tears for seeing such discrimination towards the Muslim woman. Hats off for these people. The respect I have for these people is not because they were defending the Muslim woman, but because they understand what justice really is; they chose to step in and say the truth no matter what other people would think about them.

Things got mixed up, deadlines are missed and assignments are delivered incomplete, so I need to take actions. I need to make sacrifices. I wouldn't keep away one day from Lang-8 if I had a choice, but there isn't really much options left. I take six courses; three of which, I have no idea what they are talking about. So yes, it's that bad. I'm not going to abandon the website completely. Practically, I can't do that, because I've set it to be my homepage. So, I'll be checking it once in a while. And of course, any of the Arabic learners can send me questions in messages and I'll gladly answer them all. I'll also be checking the new Arabic entries to see if someone needs help. But, I won't be writing any entries for the next two weeks. It's not like I've been waiting to write about some brilliant and impressive topics. This might actually work for my favour as it'll give me some time to think about some good topics. I'm not sure if I have the time for that but I'll try to find it somewhere.

Is the source of happiness material or incorporeal? Is it absolute thing or relativism? How could we know we are living in happiness? Questions give us more opportunity to discover truth and to be able resolve many things that disturb our goal.

For example, if there is a serial killer who is using M-16 to kill people in the street and you can stop him by killing with the knife in your hand, this is better than just watching the crime or protesting with your voice!\n",

      "textContent--->Rock In the Middle Of the Road Once upon a time, a king had put a big stone in th middle of one of the main roads in his kindoms. Then, he disappeared behind one of the bushes. He kept watching people's reactions to the rock which was placed in a very awkward spot. The wealthy people walking down the street saw this stone, looked in amazement at it, walked around it and continued going on their way. Some other people saw it and started talking about negligence of the people in charge, and that the king isn't doing his job by checking on those things. Finally, a farmer who was coming back from his field, going home, carrying basket full of fruit on his shoulders saw this stone. He quickly put his basket aside, pulled up his sleeves and with all his strength, he started lifting the big stone all by himself. He managed to put it at one side of the road. When he bent to pick his basket back up, he found a bag put in the spot where the stone was, in the middle of the street. He picked it up and found that it was full of gold, a note was also attached to it. The note said, \"This gold belongs to whoever takes the stone off the road.\" So, the poor farmer earned the kings gold, and also, learned a lesson, that whatever obstacles one encounter in life, these obstacles must give them something new which will turn them into a better person.\n",
      "textContent--->Antigone. Antigone is a play written by Sophocles in the Greek times, and it is related to Oedipus`s legend. It is meant to raise the difference between human law and divine law. The incidents of the play tell about a law that made by Creon -the portagonist of the play-and this law is symbol of the tyrannical authority of him. By this law Creon forbids the burial of one of Antigone`s brothers claiming that he is traitor. Creon forgets that man`s soul couldn`t find rest except when it is buried. Therefore, Antigone-the heroine of the play-tries to bury her brother because she beleives that it is wrong to obey such a law which insults human dignity. She beleives that this law stands against God`s well and rules. She decides yo bury her brother because she convinced that human laws aren`t perfect, and they can be broken at any time when it is necessary. Through out the play we find her facing death just because she beleives in God`s law, when she says\"I please whome most I ought to please\" we really understand that she isn`t concerned of pleasing the king as much as she is concerned of pleasing God. Antigone is a tragic hero not because a hamartia but because she leads  a life of the tragic heros,she suffers until she buries her brother, and she lives in a conflict like the the tragic heros. If we come to creon, he is the Aristotlian and typical tragic hero. He is a king which means that he is from a high rank but he has an obvious flaw which is his pride. Creon is very hubris and his arrogance blinds his eyes that he is taking the wrong decsion that leads to his tragic end. His pride makes him forget that he stands against God`s well which is the reason of his tragic downfall. In fact, Creon realises that he is mistaken by disobeyind God`s laws but it turns to be too late because he loses all his family members,his neice, his wife, and also his son. To cut a long story short, this play is very crucial because it sheds light on the typical tragic hero who is Creon, on the other hand it tells us that no one, and no law can exceed GOD`S laws. This play tells us be brave and do what you find it right, don`t follow the others if they are wrong. Don`t say that I am alone or I am not enough to change. Be sure that the slightest thing you do can make a change.\n",

Here are the Ayat which tell that truth : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c0gT6ABsDM&feature=player_embedded at 2:05 – 2:49 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2ZNZCuKwcE&feature=player_embedded at 5:42 – 6:23 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ0j13GQNUw&feature=player_embedded at 1:40 – 2:02 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAjRLnbXcJM&feature=player_embedded at 00:00 – 00-14 all of these are proofs from Allah The Creator of the universe Himself. or how can uneducated people 14 from centuries ago know things like this!? ironically, it is not us Muslims who tell the world these truth. Do You know why? because we didn’t take Islam as it should be taken and we became far from what a real Muslim should be. that’s why why are going to continue watching other people say what we should have said.

      "textContent--->Living in a dormitory. A survey made by some students studying at a college in Cairo University proved that about sixty percent of the students prefer to live in a dormitory rather than living at home during college life. They prefer to live in a dormitory  because they see that in dormitories they will : have more fun with coleagues, meet new people , have new experiances, and face new challenges. Those student say that living in a dormitory makes one meet new people, and have more fun  as one can stay up with the new coleagues playing music or games without caring a bout little siblings or sleeping parents. As well as, studying with dormitory mates makes studying easier as they will share new  ideas among eachother. In addition, living in a dormitory forces the student to have new experiances in life, and face a lot of different situations inwhich s/he has to  deal with tham wihout help from parents. That`s means that student has to depend on her/himself to lead a proper life. Moreover, one student said when one lives in a place far from his parents, old friends, familial relations,and heighbourhood, s/he begins having new challenges. For example, one tries to prove for the others ,especially parents, that s/he can take the responsibility, and s/he is up to it,and this in itself a big and difficult challenge. Based on this, students prefer to live in a dormitory because they want to learn more from life without the direct help of their parents, they want to lead their college life on their own, and they want to be independent.\n",

In Saudi Arabia I was studying at a university over there for one year, and I stopped so my plane was to come to New Zealand, and to learn a little bit of English language and improve it so quickly, because my major was English so at that time I had decided to come here before. I came here I asked one of my friends which he has been here for a long time. I told him that I will probably come to New Zealand so what do you think is a good idea, because it that time I was little bit worried. He had told me that just come here and do not worry about anything and I am sure you would love it he says. Exactly, I had left my lovely university and I came here while I was living here I had changed my mind to continue my study here, so I have done it and now I am still studying here but I have should gone to the USA, but I did not that the thing I will regret about in whole my life is the reason why, because over there the study there much easier than here so. I feel really regretted whoever it is amazing country, and so nice people and helpful as well so I have had found good things and bad things, but this is u would find them all over the world so it does not matter for me. For me I like hanging out with my friends and go crazy things and I like make jokes a lot   so I am out going that why I have lots of friends,  and having a good time here all my friends I have known them here I will never ever forget.\n",

      "textContent--->When Things Go Wrong When things go wrong, and don't work according to one's plan. When one can' t achieve a required change, they need to change the strategy of their work. Here is a story that shows how to deal with such issues. A blind man was sitting in the street with his hat in front of him, and a sign was put next to him that said, \"I'm blind, please help me!\" A man who worked in advertisement saw that there were few cents in the hat. So he put some more. And without the blind man's permission, he took the sign and wrote another advertisement on it. When he was finished, he put the sign at the blind man's leg and walked away. At the end of the day, the advertisement man passed again near the blind man. The blind man could tell that it was him from his steps. The advertisement man noticed that the hat was full of coins and cash. The blind asked him if he rewrote the sign, and what he wrote exactly. \"Nothing but the truth,\" he answered. Then, he smiled and went on his way. What was written on the sign is: \"We are in the spring, but I can't see its beauty.\"\n",
      "textContent--->My first English book! Today I started reading a book writing in English. I used to read books only in French, even those who are not originally wrote in French. In fact I was not intended to read English book yet, I was afraid I can't understand most of it, though I read different articles in English on the Internet, but a literature book would be difficult! When I went to the library looking for some books to buy, I saw some books in English; most of them are Shakespeare's, and no way I would even think to read them! And there was a thin book titled : The importance of being Ernest, by Oscar Wilde, I got my courage and decide to buy it, after all it's a little book so it won't be hard, and I saw the movie and already know the story and that will helps. I start reading it today and almost finish it, and for my big surprise it was really understandably, I didn't had any difficulty, in the contrary it seems easier than other text ( teaching texts) I read, I guess good literature and good use of a language even in a classical way make it more easy, unlike what most people think. Of course I don't think that a Shakespeare's will be that easy, for he use a very \"classic\" English and very tragic, which will make it  harder to me, any way I don't like tragic stories! but Wilde is more simple and light, I read his book \" the portray of Dorian Gray\" but the French version, so I think that I like him, and I will look for other writing but it must be as thin as the one I'm reading! :)\n",

      "textContent--->Inception (The movie of the year) I could safely say that this is the best movie I've seen so far. It is absolutely incredible. I'm still not sure how could anyone get an idea like this and turn it into a movie. This movie is actually much more complicated than it seems. I've watched this movie twice to understand the details that I missed in the first time. But even after the second time, I was still confused about the ending. I was not sure whether Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) was stuck in limbo or got back to reality as the movie ended before the totum stops. This was the only point I was confused about until I read an explanation to it that made me find out that we all -- my friends and myself -- got it totally wrong (the whole movie). The explanation was shocking that it made me feel so stupid. I wouldn't have understood it that way, not in a million years. I'm going to share the link of the explanation with you, but please, if you didn't watch the movie yet, don't read the review. Give yourself a chance to understand the movie by yourself which will keep you in some suspense when you read the explanation and find out what was really happening.

The first show that I can remember was displaying on Dubai Channel called \" Fortress \".

I became on of the fans to this show, After I saw an ugly face man was taking down the other wrestler and and gave him the last knockout, he started bleeding and started screaming and pulling the man to move away from him, the arbitrator announced on the death to him, I shocked and said: Is this man a monster?

And some days there are a very very hot air, as same as you just sit near a stove. Sometimes you can't breath easily because of the humid. It's in the coast of the Arabian Gulf.

I hope I can spend all winters there.\n",
      "textContent--->For beginners in Arabic Lately I see a lot of those who are learning Arabic complaining about the \"tachkil\" (don't know if there is name for it in English!). Some think that it makes things very difficult, others can't understand them! So I have to explain what \"tachkil\" is good for. Originally there was no \"tachkil\" in Arabic neither \"dots\": no dots on the ف, ق, ب, ي, ت, ض, ز ... and as you can see there is no way to make the differences between ب, ت, ي for example. Still, the Arabs could easily and without any problem recognize them. The Arabic is a very precise language, in a way you can explain exactly what you mean and let no doubt with less words, because every word have a precise meaning, and Arabs was almost obsessed with the language so they was genius in the arts of poetry and words puzzles. After the expansion of Islam, a lot of non-Arabs start learning how to read in Arabic, and that was very difficult, and so Arabs start to make some helpful adds to the letters to preserve the language (because when a non-Arab try to read or translate from Arabic he may make a lot of mistakes due to resemblance of the letters and some words that have same spelling but pronounced differently). Now the dots on the letters are indispensable, and you can see letters without dots only in antique documents, in another hand \"tachkil\" is just to help beginners and once they get familiar  with the language and learned the basic rules they don't need'em any more, and as I said before; it's like a third wheel! As for me, I'm a very beginner in English and need correction for this entry :)\n",

I've never done a long distance relationship before, but they're really difficult, aren't they? I hope that even though we are so far away that we will be together forever. I really hope that we will never break up. Because I really really love you. I want to get married to you. So, I'll do my best researching too. I want to do my best for you. I hope that you will be able to be happier starting tomorrow! I'm not good at putting things like this into words, but I think that everyone should try to live positively. I've always felt this way You have to face your problems positively because happiness lies within your own hands, you have the power to create your own happiness. Whether you are happy or not depends on the ways that you solve your problems. If you're feeling tired, you'll be alright after taking a break, don't push yourself too hard--this is important too:) If something bad happens, you first have to accept it to be able to move forward. First look for the cause, then you'll be able to move forward. So let's try being more positive from today:) I love you! This email was sent by Jackie last night. After I read this email, I thought she really did her best to tell her feelings!!! I'm really happy to find her. I will never dislike you. I don't want to say that.

      "textContent--->PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE FOR MEN. I will have to speech in my class room next monday. but I can't think of serious topic so I decide to talk about techniqques for men. There are two types men. Some men are very popular with women,others are not. Of course,These things include our face,money,background  and so on. But between popular men and not popular men have a lot of difference. To begin with,I am talking about how to ask girls out. In asking a girl out,It is important to make her imagine concrete date. If you said just\"Do you have a time tonight??\" She couldn't imagine date. On the contrary,it makes her have negative image. So you should tell her when the date finishes. Almost women don't actively feel like dating with someone who is not friends with her. Above all, like the date she can't understand when the date finishes. So you had better tell concrete plan her \"do you have a tea time 30 minutes?\"when you ask her out. Secondly,It's important to add some reason for the date. If you say just\" I wanna date with you\",a reason of the date is only one which she meets you. If this case , if she accepted the invitation,she would thought a sale of herself. So you must have a valid reawson to make her accept your invitation. By valid reason,she will take up your invitation easily.\n",

In the school we did the exercise of design and drawing of a museum. Those who couldn't finish the exercise within the time limit have to do it at home until next Sunday. I couldn't finish it. So I have to finish it at home. Today, I saw the plan which I drew yesterday. I found that my plan is in breach of the condition of the problem. The problem specifies that a museum shop shall be located near an entrance hall. But in my plan the museum shop isn't located near the entrance hall. Fortunately, I can avoid this breach by making a trade of the location of the museum shop for the location of the toilet near the entrance hall. But I've made the drawing partway. I have to revise my drawing. In other words, there is a regression in my drawing process. I should be careful to read a sentence of a problem before drawing in order to avoid a regression.\n",

So, I try to look back over the past in brief. ・September I went to see the musical \"Sound of the music\"(by Gekidan Siki) with my friend for the first time. Unfortunately,all songs were Japanese. However, Their acting and orchestra's sounds were very good. I had very good time♪  ・October There weren't any special events…. I practiced to play the trumpet for the group lesson. I practiced \"Feel like makin' love\" then. ・November I bought an used PS3 to watch Blu-ray disc of GRANRODEO's live. I was crazy about GRANRODEO for this month. Because their live was held at NHK hall on November 23th after an interval of six months. That day was the 5th anniversary year's day from their debut. I was very happy to hear their songs directly after a long time. ・December On December 18th, my dear Roro's birthday♪　She became 3 years old. I hope she grows up in good health. Except it, There is no special. I studied English and practiced the trumpet. I started to practice \"The Chicken\" from this month. ・January One week ago, in first trumpet lesson of this year, we got a task from the teacher. It is to compose the part of our own solo. I have never written music～！ It is difficult for me…. I hold my head in my hands!! These were my recent situation.

I know my weak point very well, which is nothing but vocabulary. In Japanese language, it is easy to infer the meaning of unknown words because Kanji (漢字) has meaning itself. On the other hand, it is very hard in English. Especially, the shorter the word is, the harder to infer its meaning. Same thing is memorizing. Memorizing English words is a kind of pain to me. Isn't there any good way to memorize many unknown English words without pain?\n",

It made me determnine to write a diary every day even though I can write short sentences. Hope I will continue updating my diary from today. On the other hand, I have a worry that I may give up my mind sooner or later. Here we have a Japanese saying, \"Mikka - Bozu\", calling those who cannot strive to carry on their big plans more than three days. The word 'Mikka' means three days and 'Bozu' means a bald kid. I wonder if there is any expression describing the same meaning in English.\n",
      "textContent--->Japanese Kawaii and English Cute Yesterday after I read one of my lang-8 friends’ journal entry, I thought that I wrote this entry. In the entry she wrote about Japanese word \" kawaii\". I think Japanese \"kawaii\" and English \"cute\" are a bit different. Our kawaii has a lot of meaning. For example, when we look at a \"cute\" dog, we think it is kawaii. The cute meaning and our kawaii meaning are same, I think. On the other hand We use kawaii for guys. For examples, when I listen to my language exchange partners' Japanese phrases, I sometimes think that their Japanese sounds very kawaii. I think when Gaijins speak Kansai accents, it sounds very kawaii for me. When I ate lunch with one of my partner, Mark, he ate a peace of cake with big smiling like kids. I thought he is very kawaii. In fact his behavior is always kawaii for me. Maybe I don't have sons; he and I have a big generation gap. In addition, American people are good at expressing their happy feelings. Therefore, maybe I always think he is kawaii. If I express my kawaii feeling with using \"cute\", I guess that my foreign friends can't understand my feelings. I think kawaii is one of the words which we can't translate into English. Therefore, when I describe kawaii feelings, I always use \" kawaii\" to my language exchange partners. I hope my entry is helpful for your Japanese knowledge.\n",

I went Ireland for Thanksgiving as I posted my journal while ago. Thank you so much for all recommendation for this trip! We left Los Angeles in November 26th and arrived at Dublin, Ireland on the 27th. On the first day, we visited Guiness Storehouse. It was very big building and displaying a lot of interesting stuff about their beer. Guiness is celebrating their 250th anniversary this year! On the second day, we were planning to go to the Cliffs of Moher and Ashfort Castle which is both located west side of Ireland. I heard about flood in Ireland from a friend from Lang-8 so I was worried about it. On our way to the Cliffs of Moher some road was flooded and can’t make it thru and needed to take different road to get there. We finally arrived around 4pm there after four or five hours of driving but the sun sets around 4:15pm there we couldn’t see nice view. We couldn’t make it to Ashfort Castle that day and needed to give up on the castle because we have some other stuff to do on the 3rd day and 4th day. I really wanted to see one of the most beautiful castles Ashfort Castle! We headed back to the hotel in Dublin from the Cliffs of Moher and our GPS made us took really tiny road which barely fits one car. It was very foggy even daytime. I haven’t seen such a thick fog before! During the journey we found a few rabbits on the road and they jumped in front of our car. They go forward as we go so we were kind of chasing the rabbits with the car. Our 2nd day didn’t go as we planed but still fun. I will write about 3rd and 4th day on later post.\n",

      "textContent--->Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Use reasons and specific details to support your answer.Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants,and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. I'm for this statement, and smoking should be prohibited as long as possible. Frst of all,  smoking is not good for our health. According to the latest study, smoking higher the risk of various illness, say, cancer, heart attack, stroke,and so on. WHO reported that 4.9 million people are killed by the smoking per a year. The smoke contains more than 4000 chemical substances, and a lso more than 50 cancer's resourses. Futhermore passive smoking also causes nonsmoker of lung cancer, the respiratory disease, the sudden death of an unborn baby. This graff(http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB:Cancer_smoking_lung_cancer_correlation_from_NIH.svg) shows us there seems to be close connection between the amount of smoking and the risk of lung cancer's death. Besides, more than 12% of all death per a year in japan is caused by smoking. For such reasons,smoking isn't good for our health. Second of all, smoking causes the great loss rather than benefits. Latest Japanese government's report shows that the cigarette's tax income is amount to 227 billion dollars. However the World Bank expects the abolition of smoking would generate more job opportunities and business chances. Futhermore Japanese government reported that smoking causes more than 400 billion social loss. According to the interesting sturdy, the higher the ratio of smoking become, the more the number of those who are in porvoty is in a society. So it is absolute that smoking causes great loss rather than benefits on our society in terms of fibnance. In conclusion, i'm for this statement because smoking causes great loss rather than benefits in both terms of health and finance. However , on behalf of smokers, they have rights to smoke and smoking is a relaxing activity for them. And it seems neary impossible to ban smoking completely. So the government or the owner of restaurants should make place for smokers.\n",

Bruges, one of the World Heritage sites, looks like a medieval town. I think Bruges is the best place I visited this time. Incidentally, when I was waiting for the Cathedral Notre-Dame to open in Antwerp, a young woman came up and talked to me. She seemed to be doing a sightseeing questionnaire. She asked me many questions; Japanese? How many days are you in Antwerp? Did you stay a hotel in Antwerp? What’s the hotel name? How many stars does the hotel have? What was your first impression of here? Where are you going in Antwerp? Where else are you going in Belgium? And she asked me, “How old are you?” I said, “Fifty-seven.” She wrote down thirty-seven. I said, “No, fifty-seven.” I must have looked like a thirty-seven-year-old woman because she was surprised. I want to believe that my pronunciation wasn't the problem.\n",

If you have a questions you should try to ask them. I think they'll give you a good anwers and you'll resolve your Japanese problems. It might good if you ask them in English because they can speak English.\n",
      "textContent--->It Is Hard For Me To Express My Thinking In English I have a question. If you can't express your thinking in another language which you are studying, how do you try to describe it? Do you try to communicate with a body language? If you can't use a body language in front of them, what do you say? Do you give up to communicate them? I have some experience like that. I have a student of double schools. One is a real English conversation school, and the other is an online English conversation school. Since my English teacher at real conversation school, Sean can speak Japanese, if I can't understand his English, he suggests me some Japanese words. However, my online English teachers are all Filipinos, and they can't speak Japanese at all, I make some trouble with them. I can understand their conversation but I sometimes can't explain my thinking well. Although at that time, I try to figure out different phrases, it is quite hard for me to explain my thinking. I know why I can't express my thinking well. That's why my English vocabularies are very poor. I must remember more synonyms and antonyms. How do you remember new words? How do you keep new words in your mind? They are also hard for me.\n",

Every week they have \"Car Talk Puzzler, in which one of the listeners who send the correct answer gets a prize. They told us the answer to the quiz last week. I found it interesting, so I tried to write it down. ********** I'm thinking of two inventions long ago. One of them has thousands of moving parts. The other has one part and it doesn't move. They both do the same thing. Or at least they did the same thing. Oh, they still do. If you had these in front of you. They would still do what they did. Both of them measure something. What they measure is the passage of time. One is the sand glass which has thousands of grains of sand that move, and the other one is the sun dial. Do they not but have no moving parts. It sits there . the sun moves. But the sun dial doesn't. And both of them measure the passage of time. And one has thousands of moving parts. ********** I couldn't get the words in this sentence very well. \"Do they not but have no moving parts.\" Do you have any idea what it could be? I know they will post the answer in their webpage in a couple of days, but.... I CNNNOT WAIT! I'd appreciate if you could clear up the fog on my mind... thank you.\n",
      "textContent--->A Tip To Study Your Other Language  My Australian friend is a very diligent Japanese leaner, and he has given me lots of good influence. Today I would love to share one of them with you. Right now he is focusing on making a famous Japanese people's names list because of expanding his knowledge about Japan. I think that it is a very effective for him to chat with native Japanese speakers. That's because when he listens to some Japanese famous people's name in conversations, if he doesn't know the names, he can't keep up with the conversations. However, if he has some knowledge about them, he can enjoy conversations with his Japanese friends. For instance; Please imagine I'm chatting with you. Me: Yesterday I enjoyed watching \"Ryomaden\". You: Oh, yeah? Who is playing in the drama? Me: One of my favorite actors, Masaharu Fukuyama. Although I guess you already notice, if you don't know who is Masaharu Fukuyama, how do you keep the conversation? You might be ask what he looks like. After you listen to about it, what is your next question? I guess that it might be difficult for you to continue our conversations because you are lack of information of Masaharu Fukuyama. On the other hand, if you already know him, after you listen to his name, you can pop up his picture and his representative works. To continue conversations might be much easier for you. You might be give some tips about him that your Japanese friends haven't known yet. It will happen to me when I chat with my foreign friends. Therefore, I also would like to make my own famous people's list. I think it's very useful when I chat with my foreign friends in a group conversation.\n",

But it is this unusual way of getting its  food ― most bats feed on insects not blood ― that also makes the vampires unusual in their social behavior. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

The contents are of course interesting, and the way presenters speech also makes me fantastic.

You couldn’t correct pronounce a language, you haven’t learned it. But, students who professor met in Japan wasn’t able to correct pronounce and uses a negligent way of speaking. Professor felt anxious the present situation. And he had begun to teach junior high school students again since ‘Sea urchin’. One student teacher doesn’t correct Student’s incorrect pronunciations, on the contrary, praised it. And he taught students to incorrect pronunciations, ‘Sea urchin’. Professor disappointed and started action for students begin to learn English. And the other student teacher said: Can students correct pronounce L and R? It is hard for us to do it. Think about English teachers. Divide Pronunciation-guidance into 4 types. Type AA: Demand of students that they correct pronounce, and can correct pronounces. Type AB: Demand of students that they correct pronounce, and CANNNOT correct pronounces. Type BA: NOT demand of students that they correct pronounce, and can correct pronounces. Type BB: NOT demand of students that they correct pronounce, and CANNNOT correct pronounces. Professor hopes you to type AA. Because using correct English brings you and students happiness. \t(186 words)\n",

      "textContent--->My typical Sunday Even though this is Sunday, I got up at six in the morning and got my jobs done as usual. I had expected it would be windy around noon- because the forecast said so- so I decided to attend a tennis circle, which I usually attend during weekend,  earlier. I started to play at  8:40  instead of  usual 9:00. And, I left there at 9:40- earlier than usual- because the wind got stronger  as I expected. Now, I came back to my house and started to learn English again. My wife is still sleeping as she usually sleeps until almost noon at weekends. Sunday is the most likely off day for me, too, because I have only little things to do for our business. I think my wife and I will go to an Italian restaurant for our lunch because my wife told me that she wanted to eat Italian food yesterday. There are so many Italian restaurants in my city. We will go to our favorite one. Their food, service, and white based open interior is just better than others. After that, I think we will go to the cafe and read books written in English. My wife will read \"Charie and the Chocolate Factory,' and I will read \"Hole,\"  which we have just started to read. Anyway, I am happy about that she has lately started to read English books and it seems she has been really enjoying it. It has become our common hobby. After that, we might go to the shopping mall which has just opened last year. I have nothing to buy but for window shopping. I don't know if we will go out again for dinner or not tonight-most of the time we go out. What I am sure is that the rest of the dinner time I will just keep studying English and have a fun. I think this is my typical Sunday. Nothing is special but I really like it.\n",
      "textContent--->Please, Could/Would 1. Please pass me the salt. One night, a family is having dinner togheter. A child says, \"Pass me the salt,\" and then Mother says, \"What's the magic word?\" then a child says, \"Please pass me the salt.\"  But in some formal settings/circumstances/situations, adding just please is still a bit impolite. A man, who are annoyed by the chatter of girls next to his room, would say, \"Speak lower, please.\" This phrse wear a bit caution or irritation. 2. Yes, please On a plane, a passenger was asked by a flight attendant, \"Would you like a cup of coffe?\" then she says, \"Plase.\" I think it is more polite than just saying, \"Yes.\" I can say, \"Yes\" and then \"Please\" for adding some politeness. Otherwise two kids, Mary and Jane, are arguing about Jane's cheat on a test. Mary says, \"I'm gonna tell what you did to Mr. Grayman ( who is their terrifying teacher)\", then Jane said, \"Please\" in an aloof manner. This please means, \"I don't care,\" or \"Whatever,\" or \"Do as you like.\" 3. Oh, please I always tell jokes even if it is not appropriate or not. Men are easy to tell jokes to but I know telling jokes often disturbs one's mind. The other day, on Skype, I got a first contact from a Turkish woman. She said she is woking as an import management adviser. I asked her, \"So, what's kind of product you handle? Weapons or drags?\" She said, \"Oh, please.\" I think this means, \"Oh my God, please stop kidding/telling jokes.\" it might be no jokes at all if she really import weapons, but in this case it worked indeed as a joke. 4. Could you? Would you? What is the difference between, \"Could you open the door?\" and \"Would you open the door?\" In my understandings basically \"Could you...?\" means, \"Are you able to...?\" and \"Would you...?\" means, \"Are you willing to...?\" or \"Do you have a will to...?\" \"Could you... ?\" or \"Can you...?\" is probably used by bank robbers: Bank robber1: Hey, can you open the door? Bank robber2: I can't. Bank robber1: Ok, I'm done with you. Die. *bang* \"Would you...?\" is used by Mom. Mom: Would you stop playing games? Child: No. Mom: Would you do your homework? Child: No. Mom: Would I get angry? Child: Yes. Mom: Ok, you make me angry. *bang* Would you give me some comments, please. Thanks in advance.\n",

Hi everyone, A new bullet train called Kyushu Shinkansen 九州新幹線 opened on 12th Mar 2011, the day after the earthquake. The bullet train links Kagoshima and Hakata by 1h19m, and Kagoshima and Osaka by 3h45m. Before its opening, a short TV commercial had been broadcasted in Kyushu islands every day, introducing a special train due on 20th Feb equipped with a camera to shoot people celebrating the opening of the new line along the rails. Event announcement (15 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDOyJtAQulo On 20th Feb at 10:55, the special train with rainbow colour decorations departed the Kagoshima central station and ran towards Hakata for the shooting. It is said that 15,000~20,000 people joined this event along the rails of 250 km. And below is the TV commercial shot from the special train. This TV commercial was broadcasted on 9th Mar. But it was only two days later when the earthquake occurred and the TV commercial was once withdrawn from the TV. On the next day, all the scheduled opening ceremonies were cancelled, and the bullet train started running quietly. In April a lot of people still remembered the 'phantom' video and they demanded to watch it on TV again. A morning news TV programme featured the making of this video. Then it started to be broadcasted again since 22nd April. The commercial video won the gold and sliver prizes in International Advertising Festival held in Cannes. OK, then. Now enjoy the wonderful video! 「祝! 九州縦断ウェーブ」九州新幹線全線開通 特別編 (180 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5kU6mImUh0 総集編 (180 sec) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBAqod0_DPw More videos available from here http://www.youtube.com/user/shuku9wave Picture gallery http://www.shuku9.com/poster.html Probably because now I watch this after the devastation by the tsunami, and also because I'm off Japan, I'm so moved by the lovely people in this video.

I bought carrots, Japanese Taroes, and burdock from pal*system (see the picture below). The farmers made an effort to raise the vegetables without a weed killer and agricultural chemicals. So the vegetables are safe and delicious in comparison with other vegetables in supermarkets. Last night I cooked them into Kenchin soup (a picture below). It warmed me and my family.

On that day, my friends promised to treat me dinner and I asked them the Okonomiyaki. The restaurant offers many different types of Okonomiyaki; for example, cheese, Kimuchi or rice cake. We had a deal because I bought some American brand clothes for them in US and carried them in my suitcase to Japan. In return, I got complimentary Okonomiyaki. My friends love American casual brand clothes such as Abercrombie and Hollister. Those clothes are very expensive in Japan and very hard to get. That's why my friends feel very special when they wear. It seems the brand became popular in Japan because Japanese celebrity or model in magazines wear. In America, I heard that those brands are basically for teenagers. My friends turned already late thirties; however, they love the design and say that the size fits very well. I think they feel still young in the clothes. I am also pretty happy when I see my friends wear American clothes happily. Thanks to the American brand clothes, I had really lot of Okonomiyaki.\n",

This is a common practice for teachers in an elementary school or a junior high in Japan. When opening of a new school year, a teacher visits homes of each students of their home room that have about 40 students. The purpose of visiting is to know the family environment of each student. But they stays at each home only 20 minutes! Just 20 minutes! Is it enough to understand a family environment of each student? The trouble is that I have to clean up my house to get a teacher of my son just for a 20 minutes meeting! It's too much of a bother! Do you think about that?\n",

      "textContent--->TOEFL TOPIC #1 TOEFL TOPIC  Some people prefer to work for a large company: others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice. Answer Some people prefer to work at a large company. Other people would like to work at a small company. I would like to work at small company. There are three reasons that I prefer to work at a small company. First reason I prefer working at a small company is that it’s easer to know people who work at the company. If I work at company, I would like to know people who work at the company and what they do at the company. However, if it is a large company, it would be harder to know every one, and their work. So I would like to work at a small company. The second reason I would like to work at a small company is that I would like to think people at work as a friend or family. Now I’m working at a small company. There are only six people working there. When we are busy we help each other, because we think each other as friends and family. If it is in a large company, it would be hard to think that way. This is the second reason that I would like to work at a small company. The third reason I prefer working at a small company is that I would have more chance to communicate with an owner of the company. I worked at a large company, and I had never met the owner. However, I’m in a small company, and I have many chances to talk to the owner. So that, I am able to know what the owner expect to me, and what he want me to do. Those are three reasons that I would like to work at a small company. However, I realized that everyone has a different opinion of this. I will respect all of our view.\n",

Today, I'd like to talk about why a lot of people like to decide something at a conference. One big reason, and it is the only thing what I'd like to tell to everyone clearly. It is make the responsibility vague. because of it has been decided by everyone at the conference. I don't like this kind of thing, to talk at conference is to get everyone's idea and to find something they didn't know, not for make the responsibility vague. but some bad companies(I hope it is not majority companies) actually use conference to decide something. and if the idea or project fail, the responsibility is not the boss or leader. may be it is only a few Japanese company, I hope so. and I worked at foreign capital company before, some rule at Japanese company looks really strange for me. one of them are the boss doesn't have the authority to fire and employ their subordinates. ok, I will write about it tomorrow.

However, I have three writing assignments and I must write them in English. One of them requires me to collect data or information about the subject, which is quite troublesome. Today, a Chenese student, who is an international student at my university, asked me a few questions about Japanese that he couldn't make out, and I answered the questions. I found it more interesting than I had expected to help foreign people with Japanese, and answer their questions. There is, however, a happy news to me. A few days ago, I was hired to a part-time job! I can earn some money at last. Now, Japan has a sluggish economy, which makes it rather hard to find a job. Especially in Hokkaido, where I live, it is almost impossible for me to find a job I'm interested in. I can't help feeing nobody can change this economic situation of Japan.\n",

She was not able to get a winning individual as same as Kurumu Date, she backed to this field since twelve years and was a great success. But Sugiyama's consecutive game record is registered in the Guinness Book of Record as the new world record. Personally, I need to learn her emotional strength that she managed to get in the game for sixty-two straight times during her experience. Naturally, she had a lot of tough situations such as injure, spiritual problem. Sometime she might felt herself that I want to quit tennis now because I don't want play tennis anymore, maybe she thought. I heard from her interview on TV before she's going to announce her retirement in front of public, and she said that it was most important helps was my mother, and her support's helped my career, I would I had to retire tennis earlier without it. In fact, some tennis player hired private assistant coach, some other's asked their relate family. I think that their relate are so helpful. For example, they make healthy choices about the foods her eats and let her tell everything she's worry. Because she only has a two-month to spend in Japan when she goes on the road. I had an idea when I was young which I want to do everything I have to do is sometime good. But it has limitations; I often had a mistake when I tried to everything I want to do. I'm able to learn again that I can't achieve anything from her experience; we need to make many great supporters and to have an emotion to belong together.\n",

I thought I would grow in capability of learning until about 20 years old, as well as height. Since then, it would decrease with age. Uncousciously I had limited my potential. For example, when I was in high school, my grade was so bad that I couldn't enter a med school. To be honest, I couldn't even take an entrance examination for it. I gave up a dream to be a medical doctor and I entered other university's Faculty of Science. But there I had studied very hard. And in my researh activity about oncology, I thought I didn't have any choice to enter a med school to study the medicine. Eventualy I became a medical student. 'Where there is a will, there is a way' This is only one example. Don't you limit your potential? Just do it! You can do it! (In Japan, in Febraly there are entrance exams for most universities.)\n",

As soon as I noticed him, I said, “Good morning.”  He turned over toward me and replied with a smile. Then several topics I would like to talk with him came into my mind. However, unfortunately they were all in Japanese. I felt I needed some time to translate them in English but I didn’t want to keep him waiting. Maybe I didn’t want to admit I couldn’t speak English fluently. I didn’t want to hobble or get time saying “Err” or “Hmm.”   What I really said was “How are you?” He was very friendly and said he was sleepy because he had watched the soccer game where Japan beat Denmark early in the morning. I smiled and wanted to say something more about it. I really did want to. However, I ended up saying, “Oh, really?” and “Good-bye.” I could have said, “Did you root for Japan or Denmark?” or “I didn’t think American people were into soccer unlike Japanese.”  That was what I thought afterwards. What happened to me? I thought I had already conquered the fear of making mistakes. Now I feel I am getting back to the first stage.\n",

      "textContent--->Kamakura Today I will write about my hometown Kamakura. It will take about fifty minutes from the central area of Tokyo to Kamakura by train. Since the city is near to Tokyo, you may have visited. Kamakura is one of old capitals in Japan. It is filled with a lot of temples and shrines. You may visit the city in order to touch Japanese traditions. It is also known as one of representative urban resorts in Japan. Many Japanese millionaires have vacation houses there, and many and famous artists like to live there. I sometimes go to Kamakura Museum of Literature. The mansion was Marquis Maeda's resort house, but the City of Kamakura has it today, and it is used as the Museum of Literature. A reason that I like the mansion's garden is because we can look over Kamakura from there. I believe that you will enjoy my city, but I will tell you about the another face of Kamakura. The Japanese imperial family has a history of about 2700 years. Basically, it is impossible for a family to maintain powers such a long time. The reason why the Japanese imperial family wasn't uncrowned was because it didn't have powers, and it was not strong. Today, Japan is virtually a republic, and the Emperor has no political power. However, it was very rare for Emperors to virtually have powers in Japanese history. The current constitutional monarchy is traditionally-based in Japanese history. Since 1185 until 1868, samurai had ruled Japan. The first samurai dictator was Minamoto no Yoritomo. Although the imperial court was in Kyoto, Yoritomo established his government in Kamakura, and the government had ruled the whole Japan for about 150 years. Kamakura had been virtually the capital of Japan since 1185. The governments that was established by samurai, and ruled the whole Japan, are called 'bakufu (shogunate)'. Because the government in Kamakura was the first shogunate in Japanese history, it was not systemically stable. The last shogunate Edo bakufu could learn from foregoers' experiences, so it could have stably ruled Japan for 270 years. However, samurai in Kamakura were pioneers to rule Japan, so they couldn't have any foregoers. This is a reason why the history of Kamakura was too bloody. The moguls of the Kamakura shogunate competed with one another in order to seize powers. Since they were samurai, their competitions meant killing each other. There are a lot of sites of massacres in Kamakura. Perhaps, this was a reason why Kamakura samurai had to build a lot of temples. It's because mafia are basically pious. The Hojo clan was the most powerful mogul in the Kamakura shogunate, and they killed a lot of other clans. Some of my ancestors were victims of them. Although they didn't have any titles, they were virtually the ruler of Japan. It's difficult to criticize their politics. They were certainly violent, but they were not egoistic at least. They tried to attain their ideals for people. So they had been able to maintain their powers for about 150 years. However, one day, Mongolia tried to invade into Japan. Mongolia already occupied China, Korea, Persia, Russia and East European countries, but Japan could fortunately repel them. Although Japan could maintain its independence, the government was badly bruised economically. The Hojo clan didn't have a power to bottle frustrations of other people anymore. The imperial court in Kyoto rose up in order to regain political powers from the Hojo clan, and a lot of samurai wanted to be imperial soldiers. Their ruination was very rapid. The private army of the Hojo clan was defeated by the imperial army in various regions in Japan, and Kamakura was the last site of them. In May 1333, an imperial general Nitta Yoshisada invaded into the city with his soldiers, the people who belonged to the Hojo clan gathered at Tosho-ji temple that was their family temple. There were about 1000 people who were irrespective of age or sex. They fired the temple, and killed themselves in the fire. So there is not the temple today. The second image is the place where there was the temple. It is a very important place of Japanese history, but sightseers rarely visit. I have visited the place, but the other day, I visited again for praying. Nobody was there except me. Kamakura is beautiful. You will enjoy it, but I think that you will be able to enjoy more, if you know the history more. Thank you.\n",

But such shape atracts me a lot. AKB has a system of general election. Members are ranked by people who buy assigned CD. Members who are ranked higher than 21th can sing specific CD or next CD as selection members and ranked higher than 12th can sing such CD on TV. On the other hand,who are ranked higher than 40 can sing a song the accompanying the title song on a two-track CD as under girls. General election was held two times. She was ranked 20th at first general election. So she was elected a member who can sing. But at second general election,she was ranked 22th. She was not elected selection members. I was so sad. But she was center of under girls. Because She was 1th of under girls. It was happy  for me. By the way,today is her 16th birthday. I bought cakes  to conguratulate her.\n",

      "textContent--->CNN + NHK business English program At last I decided to buy an English text book. It was one of the NHK(, which is our National Broadcasting Corporation) radio programs and intended for advanced English learners or business people. In fact, the program has a good reputation for English learners because the high-level words, idioms etc are very helpful for them to improve their English skills. Not only these phrases, but the contexts are also interesting. However, sentences of the contexts are relatively complicated if you ask me. After all, there aren't all simple sentences in terms of talking in a daily life. That's why I had been reluctant to brush up on my English skills through the program and text book. As I prefer CNN, BBC and NHK news in bilingual, listening to these English news is one of my daily routine study of English. I can learn the machinery of the politics, society etc as well. I meant people who are advanced level have many varieties of knowledge and can discuss when they are required besides these sophisticated words. ( Some say these news also use formal expressions, aren't suitable for talking, though...)  However, I had a whim to buy the text book for a change. Right away, I listened to the radio program through the Internet. The vignette of the beginning of this month were so intriguing and helpful for me, although the sentences were a wee bit long. :D Uh... I think I'll purchase it regularly.... ^^\n",
      "textContent--->27/12/10 - Camping (part 1) If you have time, please drop by and click on one of the 3 buttons (the white one is a priority)  (so that more people will have a chance to read my blog!) http://kenichiokuma.blog86.fc2.com/ -------------------------------- I joined a camping that an aussie planed last monday and tuesday. It was a bush and costal walk from Otford Station to Bundeena  through a royal national park, which is about 27km in total. Seven people took part in it (one Aussie, three Peruvians, one Laotian, two Japanese). We slept in a tent at a place near the beach at Matawalla  after we moved 15km from the starting point. We walked to Bundeena, which is 12 km, and then took  a ferry to Cronulla on the second day. On the first day (the 27th), it was raining and cold in the morning. Because of the weather, the path was muddy and slippy. Sometimes we couldn't even find the track. It was foggy and we couldn't see landscapes. Everyone might have thought that today was the wrong day. In the afternoon, it stopped raining,  but we kept walking on the (kind of) steep mountain path. (I want to say.... that was not so steep.... but many ups and downs... how can you call that in English?) I can't remember how many mountains we crossed. I felt hard in climbing and going down mountains. I felt the harsh ocean due to the rain. I felt close to nature and the power of nature. After a long walk, we finally found a place to sleep near the ocean. We had 3 minutes cup noodles after heating a stove. Unfortunately, it was very windy so that we couldn't make fire. (camp fire?) We made tents and slept around 9:30 since we were very tired. haha People say they forget their fatigues from hard work when they was able to see beautiful landscapes. Yes, I barely felt like that, but my tiredness was still there. haha The first day became very very different from my usually day. continue... (Please drop by my blog later and see my pictures there) can you think of a better title?\n",

      "textContent--->Softball Yesterday, Japanese softball team finally got a golden medal!! They got a silver medal at the Sydney Olympic and They got a bronze medal at the Athens Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has decided to eliminate baseball and softball from the 2012 London Olympics. So I was especially glad because for softball this Olympics was final. When I was junior high school student, I joined a softball team of the school. When I joined the softball team, the manager moved different school. The manager was very good at teaching the softball. So my senior attended national convention many times. And practicing was very hard. I heard that my senior went back home at 10 p.m. every day and morning practicing started from at 6 a.m. The day off was only the New Year. When I joined the softball team, since the manager moved. So the practicing was not harder than my senior. We didn’t have the morning practice but we didn’t have day off except the New Year. The rule was strict. We had to cut our hair on the ear. When we played the softball, we had to a towel tied around our head. The towels were written good words which our senior wrote them with all their heart. When we were called someone or were warned, we had to say “hai” and raise our clenched hand. Usually, strong team seniors are strict against their junior. However, our seniors were really kind. I yearned our seniors because they were strong and kind^^ If you see the softball players, you can understand that it is difficult to distinguish which they are male or female. Actually when I was junior high school student, I was mistaken a boy. When I tried to enter the women’s restroom, a female told to me “ You have to use the men’s restroom.” >< One day, a new girl classmate came to my class. She fell me in love at first sight. After she saw that I wore the skirt. She was very reprised!! When I saw different team player, I talked with my teammate “ She is really a girl?? There is no way I can see.” (←It’s really rude!!） For me, the softball practicing was really tough. So I have decided that when I become a high school student, I never join any sports team!!!!\n",

I'm sure he mentioned his school was very strict though: And for a graduation trip, schoolies( means 3rd year students, right?) go to Gold Coast and have fan with toolies(means 20s want to have fun with schoolies, right?)

      "textContent--->The reason why Christianity does not take root in Japan. One of my friends asked me that why Christianity does not take root in Japan. So I wanna think about it and write down my thoughts. Have you ever read ''Kojiki''? It's a myth of Japanese gods. We have hundreds of gods.(the representative of our Japanese gods is woman, called Amaterasu.)  Japan is not monotheistic religious country. And I think this is the biggest difference and that's the reason why Christianity does not take root in Japan. Japanese religion such as Shinto is animism and nature worship. So, in Japan, we don't get used to the idea of monotheistic religion, such as Christianity or Islam.\n",

      "textContent--->Relationship Between Suicide Rate And Happiness  On the commute time, I used to listen to radio. Today, I got to know some interesting news regarding the relationship between suicide rate and happiness. As you know, Korea has recorded high suicide rate.* I believed that the higher suicide rate, the lower happiness because people tend to commit suicide when they're too frustrated to find any hope over the course of their lives. * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate But the host argued that suicide rate is not a crucial factor to decide whether people in a country are happy or not. Statistically, the difference of rate by country is not significant. Furthermore, some countries where national religion is Catholic have recorded low rate not because folks in these countries are happier but because Catholic church has prohibited suicide. What a surprise! I've talked to my friends that most Korean are not happy based on the fact that Korea has high suicide rate. But the figure is no longer appropriate in supporting my idea according to the host's remarks. Dear Lang-8 friends, do you agree with the host's idea on suicide rate?\n",

      "textContent--->Anxiety to be beautiful Recently, one of my friends got plastic surgery. After we got a meeting, I met her and I thought she became pretty. All over the world, people blame surgery for cosmetic purpose. most of people seem to find out whether entertainers have ever had the surgery. Even some of people became beauty after the surgery, most people are just interested in what is their face before it and say that they're too ugly, laughing at them. But I can't understand this. Is there no chance for the ugly to be beautiful? They tried to be pretty or handsome but people just like to say \"Oh, they did it. it's so noticeable.\" This world isn't impartial so the ugly tend to be at a disadvantage. In serious case, these people can be rejected in job interview because interviewees firstly check up documents about appliances, including their pictures. As a result, they've tried to overcome it, but the severe world is still laughing at them. Human have been trying to make impossible things possible. and break several inequalities such as discrimination  between men and women. Of course, there is no rank of beauty and maybe equality of beauty sounds strange. But what I want to say is that there is no opportunity to avoid partiality about beauty, If we stick our views of it.\n",

It is good but it implies if you don't get the top, you don't have any talent and you don't deserve good. This thought let down people who don't succeed and in fact few people succeed. Pursuing success is good. Make sure, however, you should acknowlize random factors and be humble.\n",

It's the original but there are a little bit different Pepero. It's called 'Nude Pepero' because the chocolate is in the snack.

But if you want to earn commissions by recruting your down-lines, your sponsor makes a critical role in your business. Making tens of, hundreds of down-lines for yourself  without sponsor's support or your down-lines' aggressive activities is very difficult.

My friend also have same problem of that. and most of Korean who study English have that problem I think. The problem is that I can't read English fast. Actually when I read Korean books I read not so fast. I think it's the similiar problem. Anyway about 7 weeks ago I took TOEIC and didn't read all the writings so I couldn't solve some questions. I know that the problem is my reading speed. So I thought if I read about 'Speed Reading' I can read English normal speed. Of course that book is written by Korean. But actually I don't know that it's the best way to strengthen my reading speed. Is anybody knows the key of this problem?\n",
      "textContent--->Blossom It's a  time for whole plants to blossom. Around my street, flowers stared to blossom. Some flowers already faded away. After flowers blossom, they sustain for only several days. Nature is teaching a lot of lessons to us. First, there is life and death. There is a time to blossom and also to disappear. Similarly, our life is same as nature. A new birth happens at this moment and a life goes to ashes at the same time. Second, nature is teaching humility to us. After prosperity, there is a disappearance. Our life is the same. We have a peak time in someday but we should not be exalted because anguish is waiting for us. A beauty can't exsit long enough. It's a pity but we don't feel its value seriously if a beauty sustains forever. Third, nature has a wonderful rule: give and take rule. A nature gives other creatures when it takes something from other creatures. We have to repsect nature and make an effort to preserve it for us and next generations.\n",
      "textContent--->new expressions ............... Thesedays, I go to kind of small language academy called micasa. During the class, we give short presentations about what's going on our daily lives. Last time, I fuzzed everytime as speaking more than usual. It was not just because I was nervous, also it was the result of studying harder for the recent days. Sounds irony, doesn;t it ? What I mean is the more I study about expressions or vocabularies, the more I'm confused, because everytime I try to use new things, it doesn't come to my mind as automatically as I wish, and it makes me mummuring(?). I wish I could use them directly as I acquire. I know it's not going to happen, since everything takes some amount of pain. I have limited expressions at my disposal especially when I speak. I use same things all the time, which I got used to. I want to go to the next step. Could anyone give me some advice ?\n",
      "textContent--->The people who talk about my happiness. They say It's better to have a dream that is not really big. They say happiness is more important than my dream so It's better to have a normal dream. I can't help but wonder what is a 'normal dream'. If you don't want to live like a monk without ambition, you  should be truthful with your desires and do your best to achive your goals. Is it wrong to set a goal trying to do my best? People give money for workers since we don't have better things to reward with. Regarding we concede we are estimated with money, is there any problem if I try to be worth big money? If I get a job that everyone can do like convenience store jobs, does it make me happy normally? Is it a sin to do my best to make good money in the future? I have desires. I want to live in a warm house, I want to take showers with hot water, I want to give money willingly if there are poor students like I was. It could be more selfish to make money only for my welfare. I don't care if they live like that or not. I want to be a person who influence a lot of people in good ways in the future.

      "textContent--->Drug Use by Teenagers In a pharmacy, people can buy a medicine for pain. Of course, some medicines require a prescription because they can cause toxic symptoms. The reason is that components of drugs are in the medicine drugs release people's pain because basically, drugs make people happy. However, some people are using drugs in a wrong way. They just use them pleasure. It is dangerous because it can spoil people's life. It is more dangerous for teenagers. Unfortunately, drugs use by teenagers is increasing. There are three reasons for this; stress from parents, persuasion from drug dealers, and curiosity about drugs. First of all, teenagers are tempted by drugs because of parents' pressure. Parents usually say someting that they want their children to do, such as studying, habits, or activities that they are doing. Since the teenagers cannot do what they want, they feel uncomfortable and sometimes angry, but it is hard to express their feeling. They seek someting else to release their feelings. Therefore, they start to abuse drugs. Even though they know that they are bad, they cannot avoid them. Next, they are easily affected by drug dealers. Drug dealers usually want to find a person who has weak points and easily accepts their behavior. Adults usually have strong opinions and social position. Because of that, only some adults who have personal problems have an interest in drugs. However, teenagers don't have these problems, but they are easily persuaded. Since they don't even know it is wrong. They cannot quit the behavior. Last, teenagers have a lot of curiosity about everything. It is a natural instinct. Teenagres also naturally have an interest in drugs. Of course, adults say it is bad. However, teenagers have more interest in drugs because screct tings can trigger their curiosity. Although they are well-educated, the curiosity still remaing. The chances that teenagers will use drugs always remain. In conclusion, drugs are being used as a medicine because it can relase pain, but teenagers use them for pleasure. The reason is that they feel preasure from parents, and they can easily be affected by drug dealers because drug dealers want them. Moreover, basically, teenagers have a lot of curiousity so that they natually have interest in drugs. To protect them, special education for teenagers is needed.\n",

      "textContent--->The usage of a final constant “ㅅ” between combined words. This lecture is for upper level Korean learners. And if you have knowledge on Chinese it would be helpful. As you know(or not) most Korean words are originated from Chinese. And there are some Korean words which are consist of (or comprised of?) two Korean words which are originated from Chinese character. Mostly, they don’t transform, but there are 6 exceptional words which should put “ㅅ” as a final consonant if a former word does not have any final consonant. One of the words is 숫자. Which is a combined words of 수(數: number) and 자(字:character). Since the other 5 words are not commonly used, 숫자 is enough to explain. In addition, when you are using a combined words of a word with Chinese meaning and Korean words you also have to put “ㅅ” in between. For example, 코(nose: pure Korean) + 병(sinckness: originated from Chinese) should be 콧병. This grammar system is even difficult for Korean and they make a mistake a lot. If you can utilize the system perfectly, it means you are better than me in Korean \n",

Sounded like that somethings run very fast or someone scratchs something. When I first heard that sound, I couldn't sleep well. I used to wake up whenever I heard the noise on the ceiling. I told my second master of school living next door about that I couldn't sleep well because of the noise which mouses made, so do something. After that, there wasn't any noise for a few weeks. He told me that he put the rat poison down on the ceiling. Um....... However, Now, other rats reappeared. They didn't harm to me so far.

The Green Growth Committee under the presidential office opened the 8th Green Growth Committee meeting led by President Lee Myeung-bak on Thursday under the theme of \"Green Growth in the market\" focusing on promoting green market. The government discussed ways to grow green firms including encouraging green start-ups, improving green finance and securing relevant personnel, developing green technologies, advancing into global green market. Through these strategies, the spokesperson said, Korea will localize production of main parts and materials in the green industry, most of which have been dependent on imports. He added local green firms will also be supported to make inroads into overseas market. The government said that 30 largest conglomerates of Korea put 890billion won into clean energy, 5.3trillion won in green car and 4.3 trillion won in the next generation power system. The financial budget for green growth fund will be expanded from 10.5 billion won last year to ten folded 1.1 trillion won by 2013 and as for green R&D, the government's expense will increase from 1.4 trillion won in 2008 to 3.5 trillion won by the same year.

I just want to do something that I can do alone. I tried to study English but it was horrible. I had to find my pencils in order to solve the questions in the studying books. But I didn't have any pencils so I had to go to near petrol. They doesn't sell it. At that time I realized that I had some pencils in my bag. I found them but I couldn't find my pencil sharperner. So I decided to only read the book. But suddenly the washing machine said my laundry had been finished washing. So I had to hang them on outside. And I was hungry. I cooked foods and ate. My friends came to my house so we talked together. Now I am so tired.. Maybe you would say, 'you can study now!' Well.. with all due respect, I am so tired I just want to take a rest. Oh my gosh.. the reason I am writing the entry was because I wanted to share something we can do during holidays. But none of my writing is helpful. I'm sorry.. Well.. If you don't mind, Could you tell me some stuff I can do when I get bored?^^  \n",

Also their income is quite good. Forthermore, I like the trand of the teaching style in nowadays, so I can enjoy the class. However, as a teacher there are some duties that I think teachers should have in their mind. The first duty is that teachers should make student to interest/happy to come to class. Second duty is that (as a English teacher) make students can do the general converstion in English as a final goal. Teachers always try to absorb and learn new information and knowledge. It is the lasy duty I think as a teacher.\n",

Although you think you know a lot of things about them, they may have hidden their identity to cheat you. Finally, it depends on how you think.\n",

Second, It is very comfortable to watch a movie at home. When I watch a movie at theater, I should only sit down at the allocated chair. On the other hand, we can change our pose at home freely.

      "textContent--->The Computer Nowadays,with the development of the technology,computer plays an important role in our life. As for me,it is not only a tool to learn,but also a way to entertain. At first,computer is an open library with many fields of knowledge,which will enable you do research in whatever you want. For example, if you want to study about Japanese culture,you only need to use google search tool and type the keyword \"Japanese culture\" and then you can learn by yourself. Moreover,there are many direct training programes through internet. So,you can enjoy studying at your own house. It is very convenient. Besides,when you are free,you can use computer to entertain. Computer provides you many various kinds of entertainment such as games,television or radio online... To me, I often play some funny games when I feel tired, I also browse web for new news or chat with my friends. With computer I can contact to my friends all over the world,as well as access to news improvements. I also can watch the latest famous films or movies from my room... It is clear that,computer is an essential mean to help me in my study and entertainment as well.\n",

Thank to my parent who cant afford buying for me costly cars, motobikes, or provide me with luxury things but teach me how confident I should be when I just wear normal T-shirt and jeans and canvas shoes between people who wear dress that cost more than three month salary of my part-time job.

Thank to my parents who sometimes make me unplesant by stopping me from working something with my childish price and let me realize that there are many seducements that just want me to fall deeply into black hole and I gotta be careful with them.

Thank to my parents who seems behind the times. However it makes me love them more because they have not been spending time in discovering new things just because taking  care of me, my brother and sisters. Thank to my parents who always listen to my feelings even though I can't do the same for them. Thank to my parents who teach me not know how to keep my tears when I witness heart-breaking scene, teach me how to sympathize and open my heart up for who are not lucky like me. Thank for teaching me know that no pain, no gain. Thank for forgiving my every mistakes but let me know how reproachable it is if knowing something is wrong but still do it. Thank you so much my folks for loving me like no one can love, more than I love myself, thank for many thing that I will never be able to tell all even I really would like to do it. I really wanna say all these things to you but I am too and just because i know that  whether I say to you these words or not, you will always love me like ever.

      "textContent--->examinations Yet, some people argue that examinations make students work hard. At first, examinations help teachers to evaluate what their students has gained from courses so students really want to show how well they are by working hard for the exams to get high grades. Examinations are so good chances for students to express themselves. In addition, examinations also give students a motive to work hard as they don’t wish to fall behind their friends. But if the students receive nothing back other than the grades, the real value of examinations is practically wiped out. Making the grade is personally rewarding and is an important basis for special awards (like scholarships), admission to advanced trainings and employment prospects also, as a result, students work harder and harder. On the whole, examination is the very thing that motivates students to work hard.\n",
      "textContent--->3 important things for job In my opinion, there are 3 most important things for the job, they are salary, stability and developing skills. For salary, I want to be paid high enough money to feed my family. In the future, I will marry and have some children.

      "textContent--->My essay :d it is about problems that newcomers must face whee they first come to live in another country. Problematic Tribulations of Newcomers \tHave you ever imagined about problems that newcomers might face when they get a removal to another country? It would be a terrified situation to be in for people who arrive and stay in a new place. There are many troubles that may break us down. The language, the money, and the homesickness are several typical difficulties that I’m talking about. \tFirst of all, the most imperative element for foreigners that I believe is the language. No matter who we are, where we live, and what we do, we need to know language to communicate. If we live in a country without speaking the language, we will be merely worthless people because in fact, we can’t do anything easily. It’s like a firm barrier that separates all of us from native speakers. Then we’ll get in trouble of relationship. No talking makes our life almost covered by darkness and depression. For examples, you can go to school but you can’t make any friend or understand lectures in classes. Let’s suppose you are a high school student. How would you feel when all students keep laughing endlessly just because you’re not able to understand anything and you get a wrong, baby response for teacher’s question? Furthermore, when you have to find a job or need to go to hospital, and when you get lost while going out, what would you do with no speaking and listening skill? Oh my god!!! How terrible! In conclusion, there are lots of problematical things affect newcomers for the first time they’ve lived in a new country. Those difficulties are just hurdles that needed to be overcome. There is only one advice for everyone: “Don’t move from a country to another one without considering carefully, you need to come prepare. At least, your will must be filled by determination, energy and courage, not feebleness – for sure!” I havent done it yet. but i hope is will be correct ^^ by all of you!!!\n",
      "textContent--->Ways to improve your English speaking skill Hi, i'm English learner. My writing below have many mistakes, i hope you'll help me, thank you so much. English is becoming a popular language in the world but one of difficult things with English learner is speaking skill. How to speak english fluently is the hard question to answer and i think there are some tips which will help learners to improve speaking skill: practice with yourself and with others. It can be denied that practicing English with yourself is very essential. Some people may think that learning foreign language is studying grammar and vocabulary. it's the wrong thing! If they only learn grammar and vocabulary, they absolutely don't know how to speak with English. It is the reason why you should notice to practice speaking everyday. Trying to speak words correctly and clearly in front of the mirror is the useful way. Further more, learners have to improve this skill by talking around some specific topics such as: politic, education, music. If they are addicted to English songs, they can listen songs, try to write lyrics and sing follow the singers. However, practicing with foreigners and other learners is not a bad method. Some clubs were established to help English learners. They are the wonderful places to practice speaking skill and reactive ability. In my country, one of the famous club is FA. FA helps a large number of students and pupils to speak english fluently by working in groups. Speaking is one of the important skill with learner. Trying to practing with yourself and others to improve this skil is the beneficial method.\n",

It was so memoreble for me as well as my classmates. There is a truthful, excilent boy in my class. He sent messages to all class that were about the French teacher was sick so the class would postpone to the next day. When the message came, I was sleeping, I just read and felt a bit happy because I feel lazy to go to class. I continue sleeping as natural flextion without doubt. After a few minutes, one of my classmate called to ask about the postpone. She was in doubt because she remembered that day was the fool's day. I thought she maybe right but I know that the boy is so truthful,it was impposible that he lied on us. I told my friend to not doubt too much. after ending the call, I received some messages from other students with the same questions about the postpone. I feel doubt and call the boy, He amswered the call with a voice like he was sleeping. He said see me on the next day. My all doubt disappeared. I left the bed and turned my laptop on to read some news. At 6:45, He sent me a message that was:\" happy fool's day, wake up and come to the class my dears friends\". I was suprised and prepared quik to come the class. I tried my best to do anything as fast as possible but I was still late for ten minutes, I also met other classmates at the parking-lot. Haha, they were lied the same me. when we came the class, there were just the French teacher and the most truthful boy who were waiting for remaning students. The teacher were not angry at us, on the contrary, he just smiled and told us to take a sit,then he wrote down on the board:\" poisson d'avril\". Well, no one could say anything, just looked at each other and we started lesson happily. Such a fool's day!!!\n",
      "textContent--->10th entry: \"In your opinion, why people raise money for charity? Have you ever done anything to raise money for charity?\" There are plenty of reasons raising money for charity. The most important reason is sharing luck to the Poor. As you know, Our social is developing rapidly, thus the living cost also increase quickly. As the result, the poor people are very hard to survive. People ready to give a hand to the poor who really needs our helps. Some people have a strong believe that, if we help someone right now, we will get more in the future. This belief has proved for many years. It is the truth, when we give charity to help the poor, we feels happy ourself. I also do charity whenever I have chance. Actually we have a charity fund in our company, each staff will become a member for contributing this fund. we always help the poor, especially children who have no chance to study. We help them by providing a the necessaries things like cloths, food and books as well. In my opinion, do charity is not always by giving money to the poor. As student we can do a thing such as spend time to the poor, working at charity organization. The more we give the more we gain. This is the fair life. I am looking forward to receive your valuable corrections or spend time for it. Thanks & Best regards!\n",
      "textContent--->BAMBOO DRAGONFLY- A GREAT SOUVENIR FROM VIETNAM This is my very first post on my hometown, Vietnam and Vietnamese culture. Even though my English is not very good and surely not as beautiful as what I am trying to describe, I hope that it would at least help those who have interest in cultures and Vietnam to know more about my beloved hometown. ^^ 1st episode: BAMBOO DRAGONFLY- A GREAT SOUVENIR FROM VIETNAM What is a bamboo dragonfly? - Simple answer:  It’s a dragonfly made from bamboo. What is so special about it? - Let’s see, it’s cheap, but handmade, beautiful, colorful, well- designed and… “can fly” on anything ^^ Amazing isn’t it? :) A red dragonfly lands on my finger :) A red dragonfly lands on my finger :) Actually, they can’t “fly” like the real ones but as long as you know how to do it right, place them wherever you like, they would land on it, and “fly” around it as the wind blows. As long as a bamboo dragonfly’s beak is on a specific surface or point, it would never fall, just like a real one. How are they made? - Simply speaking, they are TOTALLY handmade from bamboo. These dragonflies are made from tough and insect-proof bamboo from places like Hòa Bình, Hà Giang in northern Vietnam. It looks simple but the making process is very complicated and sophisticated. The body and the wings are crafted separately, then the wings are attached to the body by plugging into very small holes on the body’s sides. After that, the craftsman have to place the dragonfly on a chopstick’s head to test its balance ability. Adjustment would be made until the bamboo dragonfly can balance perfectly on its beak. Afterward, the craftsman uses a little clue to make sure the wings would not come apart. They are then dried under the sun and finally painted with different color and design. It’s actually a very sophisticated process since the craftsman has to calculate the length and width of the body as well as the wings very carefully so that the bamboo dragonfly can fly. The decorating process is also very time- consuming as the dragonfly is usually small. However, they are sold with very reasonable price. It’s only about 2.000 VND to 10.000 VND per bamboo dragonfly. Available in almost all color, from small to big size. And available in many places from big book stores to street vendors. (if lucky, you can find some bamboo butterflies too ^^) Hope you can find your own beautiful Vietnamese bamboo dragonfly! ^^ These are some pages where you can read about bamboo dragonfly in Vietnamese: http://blog.yume.vn/xem-blog/chuon-chuon-tre-mon-qua-tuoi-tho.sontran155.35CE40C3.html http://baodatviet.vn/Home/congdongviet/Nguoi-chap-canh-cho-chuon-chuon-tre-Thach-Xa/200910/62123.datviet And this is a Japanese TV program about Vietnamese bamboo dragonfly ^^ (in Japanese for sure :) ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRCFheUOP0A&feature=player_embedded Hope you enjoy it! ^^ Fly Vietnam!

      "textContent--->Essay:Smoking Topic: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: \"Smoking should be allowed in public places\" \tAlthough smokers have right to consider cigarette as a useful method to reduce the pressure or stress of work or life, they have to know that smoking has negative affect on their own health and everyone around them. In my opinion, I think that smoking should be banned in public places. \t There are three reasons to convince me to agree with the idea that banning smoking in public. First of all, most of people in community understand clearly that smoking harms to our health seriously. Not only the smokers but also people who breathe smoking can get dangerous diseases such as lung cancer, mouth cancer, especially early death. Following the recent research, women who smoke regularly can lead to be childless after being married or children's brain can be affected badly. Despite its clear disadvantages, a large number of people continue smoking in offices, companies or hospitals. They have total right for their life to kill their own life if continuing smoking, however, they can not force everyone to breathe poisonous smoke like them. Second, I want to talk about the issue of money. Smokers will waste much money buying cigarettes to satisfy their thirsty. Let's imagine how much money they can save without smoking. If everyday you spend five dollar on cigarettes, every months you will spend one hundreds fifty dollar and every year you will spend huge money. Instead of that, smokers should save the money to build a happy family or so on. \tFinally, my thinking consists of many potential hazards. Smoking can lead the air pollution and many problems of environment. In addition, smoking is the reason for fired building. Sometimes, smokers put out the cigarette carelessly or throw it away on the streets. It can lead the fire that nobody expects and impact on society. \tIn sum, I think that smoking should be banned in public places to protect people's health from the poisonous smoke.\n",

      "textContent--->Foreign languages Hello everybody! Yesterday I started to learn Korean on the internet. I just learnt alphabet. It’s said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese’s, so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently, while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so . I want to try to study both Korean and Japanese at a same time. Is it alright? I found that the Korean’s alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese’s. How about the way of spell? I’m always not patient enough to take a self-study for a long time. coz’ I’m a lazy girl. But I hope this time I’ll study at least until I can write an entry introduce myself in Korean. ^_^ All the “senpai” (^^) please help me with your experiences. I like to learn foreign languages, especially English. But my English is so poor even though I’ve learnt it for ~10 years. And after I entered the Japanese department, I even can’t recall any English’s grammars that I’d learnt before. I think English is most important. If I can speak both English and Japanese, I’ll have more chances to have a good job in the future. But it’s also said that it’s very difficult to learn well both of them. When I studied Japanese for a short time, I often confused English and Japanese. One time, I had an Japanese examination. We had to test 4 skills: listening, speaking, writing, reading. At the time of speaking’s skill, a Japanese teacher asked me a question in Japanese. The answer came to my mind in Vietnamese and then I nearly to spoke it out in English. (the question was about my family. when I want to say “There’re 4 people in my family. They are: father, mother, sister and I. I almost said that “。。 父と母と姉と“me””).. Especially, the Japanese’s katakana are almost took form from English, right? But the way of speaking is different. The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word, we just try to think of an English word and then spell it. For this reason, we found it difficult to spell katakana, especially when we see a katakana word that doesn’t come from English, or the name of places and people. An essay which has too many katakana words always makes me bored. I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons. When I had to fill in the university entrance examination’s admission form, I even didn’t know what I want to do in the future and who I want to be. Then I asked my brother for an advice, he said that “I like Japanese. You should choose Japanese department. If you can win a scholarship for a Japanese’s university, I can ask you to buy me something in Japan.“. I knew he was just joking but I chose it simply. ^_^. He isn’t my own brother. I was acquainted with him in a Chinese’s room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago. He is very special person, even though we’ve met in real life yet. He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend. He is very humorious and handsome >_<. He can always make me smile even when I’m in bad mood. … That is the reason why I didn’t choose English department despite I like it best. But in my university, at the second year of regular training, we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we’ll be able to study well both. My university has about 11 foreign language’s departments and some other department where teach economics, travel bussiness, computer and so on… If we’re learning a foreign language, we’re advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness’s department so that when we graduate we will have a best job. But If we want to study another foreign language, it’s ok. So next year, I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications. And when we’re at the third year, we have a compulsory subject. This is called “second foreign language”. It’s differ from the second qualifications. Because the second qualifications  also has economics, travel bussiness, computer… training and it isn’t compulsory. The second foreign language is called compulsory subject but we can choose any foreign language to study. For example, I’m learning Japanese, I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained. So, if next year I choose the English department, the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language. The compulsory  subject just has 300 sections. It’s too little to learn almost the language we choose. To learn almost Japanese, we have 4 years. After that, it’s not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently. So I want to try to study  Korean right now. I also like French too. It sounds lovely. It’s called “love’s language”, isn’t it? If I have more spare time, I want to learn French. >_< Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages? I can’t do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4: Japanese, English, Korean and French. Do you think it is alright? Do I have the ability to do?? No ones know but nothing is impossible. ^_^ I’m going to have an end-of-term examination this month. I’m very worry about it. This time  we still have to test 4 Japanese’s skill. I’m very nervous of speaking and listening skill. The result of last term, both 3 skills (listening, reading, writing), I got good marks (9,5/10 each skill), but I just took 7,5/10 the speaking skill in spite of my easy topic. And the middle-term examination, my listening skill’s mark was 5,5/10. It was so bad, wasn’t it?And the essay’s topic this time will be random. I’ll have to write anything in Japanese as topic’s request. It seems to be more difficult than last term examinations. Time is so fast, isn’t it? Next year I will be a “senpai”. >_< Time waits for no one. And life is short. We have no way except one way. This is try hard! Anyway, next year is 2010. Ha Noi will celebrate an anniversary for 1000 years of Thang Long- Ha Noi. It seems to be a big anniversary. Ha Noi welcomes all of you. We set a countdown clock near Hoan Kiem’s Lake. It’s counting down everyday... I posted 3 pictures: my special-brother’s, the countdown clock’s and a picture I took with my close friend. It was edited so much by photoshop (it looks beautiful but not real ^^). Write about \"photoshop\", It recalls me a friend’s sentence “I wish I could “photoshop” all my memories...”... The photo is taken 2 years ago. We wore wedding dress despite the absence of our bridegrooms.>_< Next time, I’ll try to translate this entry into Japanese. I think it’s difficult for me to do...

      "textContent--->Gỏi Cuốn, Vietnamese food, one of the most fifty dilicious food in the world! Today, after finishing the physical class, our group went to eat Gỏi Cuốn, one of the most fifty delicious food in the world. Although it is delicious, it is unexpensive and it is popular with people in the south of Vietnam, especially students. Its ingredients include rice vermicelli, shrimp, spring onions, girdle cake, and some pork. The ingredients seem so simple, but when it combines to each other, the taste is so nice. Most of foreigners who come to Vietnam for working or travelling like Gỏi Cuốn. They said that it has a special taste that is easy to eat and they enjoy it a lot. Once, we take our foreign teacher and her friends to eat Gỏi Cuốn, and after trying it,  they told us that Gỏi Cuốn is so delicious, they would like to learn how to make Gỏi Cuốn. After a few days, we got together and we tauch them how to roll this special food. First, they rolled and Gỏi Cuốn that they did looks funny. Just a few minutes then when they were aware of making Gỏi Cuốn, they did it faster and beautiful as well. We could see how happy they were when they finished each product. Finally, we went to the beach and enjoyed it together! We took alot of pictures to save emotional moments. Gỏi Cuốn is not only delicious, but also helps us be closer. I like Gỏi Cuốn... Am I promoting for one of Vietnamese food? No, I just tell the tuth. Haha. If you have a chance to travel to Vietnam, just try Gỏi Cuốn, you will know how taste one of the most fifty delicious food in the world is!!!

Regular habit forms my “addiction”. Regular addiction forms the only image of coffee in my eyes, and the only name coming from my mouth whenever I enter a coffee shop with my friends. For me, coffee has a natural and obvious place in my life... However, each morning passed with only coffee made me bored. I tried changing my drink. Lemon tea became my new “partner”. Its sour-sweet taste was quite different with coffee’s. My tongue gradually forgot those bitter drops. I realized that I didn’t love coffee as much as I had thought. My mouth could call another names out of “coffee”. I really thought I could leave coffee... [... ] Therefore, my tongue misses that bitter taste, my nose searches for the familiar smell, and my mouth bursts into “coffee” again... Each sense and each cell in my body seem to say that “I want coffee!” ... There are something which becomes addiction because of its familiar being. -------- I’m really bad at verb tenses -.- This is the second time I wrote an entry in English.

      "textContent--->Autumn Festival Today, I woke up earlier than normal. On my way to the office, I noticed at the end of one street corner, a shopkeeper was setting up a stall, which used to display moon cakes. Time goes so fast.. another Mid- autumn festival is upcomming. In August and September, Vietnamese people celebrate two great festivals:The Vu lan festival(also known as the Amnesty of Unquiet Spirits) and the Mid- autumn festival. During these days,many people attend to pagodas,praying for their passed mothers, feeding to the homeless souls. It's also the occasion for  those,who is living away from home, gather together,express their gratefulness to their parents and accestors by making a feast, burning joss paper and incensing in front of the house. As I was a child,I was very scared of these days. Adults told me that on the Vu Lan festival,the gates of hell was opened to let the tormented souls out,they were hungry ghosts and wandered along the street,looking for a naughty kids to eat. I was in fright so much that I did not dare to show off my face in the road at night as well as day and other child at my ages did not either. As I grow up, I have just thoroughly acknowleaged the meaning of Vu Lan festival. It's valuable tradition should be kept to next our generation.\n",

The country was in danger, everybody was panicked (I want to use the word \"perilous\" instead of \"danger\", but I don't know how to write the sentence). Just at the moment, the messenger brought the iron horse, rod and armor to the boy. The boy rose up and turned into/became a stately knight who is over 4.7 meters tall. He slapped on the back of the horse. The horse whinnied/neighed long and thunderously. The knight wore the iron armor and then take the whip and jumped on his horse. The horse vomited fire, Giong pushed his horse to gallop to the enemies. He waited in front for them, killed them off one layer to another/ from this class to other classes, the enemies died as chicken pox. Suddenly, the rod was broken. Giong immediately pulled up clusters of bamboo on the sides of street beat against the enemies. They were smashed/broken. Remnants of the army trampled upon each other to escape. The knight drove them into the foot of Soc mountain. He went to the top of the mountain, took off his armor and flew into the sky with the horse. To honor his great service, the King confered Phu Dong Thien Vuong on him and built a temple for him. Nowadays, the temple still remains in Phu Dong village, which is often called Giong village. Every year in April, the inhabitants organize a big festival. People say that clusters of bamboo in Gia Binh district are saffron (The color is not saffron, but it's kinda similar to that) because the horse vomited fire to them and the footprint of the horse made ponds and lakes constantly. People also say that when Giong's horse vomited fire, the fire destroyed a whole village and that's why the village was called Fire village.\n",

      "textContent--->I realized that I am not good at my mother tongue! Yesterday, we had a tranlating class and it was exciting for us. However, new things always make us confused and I really realise some facts that seems simple but I have ever thought about. In the class, we learnd how to translate texts from English into Vietnamses and do it by contrary. So far, when I read something in English, I can understand them if they are on fields that we have been tauch. However, to tell others what the English texts are about in Vietnamese is so hard. I can understand what they are about but the problem I have is I don't know which words I should use to translate into Vietnamese. That is because my mother tongue is not good. Honestly, in some fiels such as stock market, speciaized term's economy, and so on. There are many words that I don't understand even they are vietnamese. So if I am not good at my original language, it will be more difficult if I wanna be good at other lanuages. My classmates also have the same problem like me. Finding our problem, our teacher gave us some advices. He told us that we should read news in varieties of fields to improve our Vietnamese and enlarge our vocabulary. I think he is completely  right. I will try to do it! Thank you for reading!\n",
      "textContent--->Job security and salary should be based on \"employee performance\" vs \"years service\" (my writing for GMAT practice) Salary is considered as awards for employees for their contribution to one company. Some people think that salary should be paid base on the years of service, the time they have contributed to the company. But I myself strongly think that employees should be given the salary accordance with their performance at work. First of all, as my experiences in working for Japanese company, where salary is mainly based on long time service, I find that the employees have tend not try to find out the best way or the easiest way to finish the works. They believe that they merely work for one position of a company for long time, their salary will be higher year by year. On the other hand, if the salary is paid due to the performance of the employees, they would find out the most effective way to fulfill the task. This also saves time, and costs down for production. Thus, company can get much more profit and the salary for employees can be higher for the next year. The employees themselves can become more active and a fair competitive working-environment can be created in the company. However, long time service salary can keep the employees working for one company for a long time. This is very important, especially for the experts of the company, because the time for training one person from beginning to become a skilled one is very long and it took much hard-working. Anyway, a company, which attract employees by the salary policy based on good performance, can easily employ good skilled personnel and experts. Of all the reason I have stated above, I believe that the employees should be paid for what they have done and contributed, not for how long they have been in service for the company.\n",

      "textContent--->English, A long Journey In my opinion, English is as difficult as others, the difficulty belongs to how we study. Because someone has their own study strategies different from others, so their levels are different too. I have been studying English for  two years. However, my strategy is nothing, it seems that i study naturally. I read English magazines and try to remember vocabulary and verb collusion then. sometimes, i write essays and post them up to some grammatical correction websites then, it is really interesting if i receive some feedback that could be complements or complaints for my mistakes. I nerve mind if i write mistakes because i know after that i will get some useful experiences. in Addition to reading, I usually  listen to English teaching lessons a BBC. com, i try to catch what they speak and now i can understand a little. I think the difficulty is how long we spend on studying English. I hope you all will give me some advices. Thank you for reading this entry and looking forward to your advices.\n",

      "textContent--->Do people learn more from losing than from winning? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations. I really like the issues related to winning and losing. Perhaps, there are some people who think that losing means “the end”. But I do not think so. Everyone know that as winning in a game we feel happy. But probably not everyone realizes the fact that we can learn a lot from losing. Here I want to say in the broader sense, that is failure. Maybe you think this is silly, but I always believe that it is true. Imagine that you are walking in the street. Unfortunately, you trip over a stone, and fall down. You hurt. Immediately, you seek to reduce pain, then try to stand up. And you do not forget to remind yourself that next time must walk more carefully. A question arises : “Would you remind yourself if you did not stumble ?”. Maybe no. The stumbling helped you do more correctly. If you did not tripped, you would not hurt. Of course you would not note this, and you would not be careful. Failures in our life are the same as stumbling on a stone. After a failure, you feel depressed, fretful. You want this will not happen again. You think a lot about it, you find out your mistake. You draw a lesson from this, and will not make that mistake anymore. Moreover, when you get a trouble, you will find the way to overcome it. You know you have to act otherwise. When you stumble, you have to be careful. When you do an exercise wrong, you have to do it again. When you lose, you have to change tactics. And you will be better. For instance, you get a bad result on your math test. You change your learning method, go out less. You plan to study math. Everyday you do a lot of exercises, ask a friend to help you in math. You try a lot. Some time later, you study math better. Thus, failure makes you try harder, become stronger, and you will do better, as the review in the book “Being a happy teenager” by Andrew Matthews. Failure or losing also helps us to know more about ourselves, thereby we chose the other way which suitable for us. For example : I attended the Japanese singing contest in Sakura Festival this April. I sang so badly, so I was eliminated. And I realized that I can’t sing. Perhaps I’m better at drawing, because I always get 10 marks in art at school. You may also know : President Lincoln has failed in business for 2 times, failed in election for 8 times. And after 30 years of effort, he was elected the 16th president, and is one of the greatest presidents in history of the United States. Basketball superstar Micheal Jordan was cut from high school basketball team because of his \"lack of skill\". Our famous American film producer, director, screenwriter, voice actor, and animator – Walt Disney, was ridiculed by a newspaper editor because he had no good idea in film production. We all see what they have done. But they succeeded not because they were lucky, that because they made efforts. They did better after their failures, therefore they succeeded. People often say : “Failure is the mother of success”. This is true everywhere in the world. For instance, we Vietnamese say : “Thất bại là mẹ thành công”. Japanese people have an similar idiom: “Shippai wa seikou no moto”, that means “Failure is the origin of success”. Personally, I think it is correct. So, when you fail, you not only receive the suffering but you learn more from losing than you think. Losing is not the end, losing is the beginning if we take the advantage of its beneficial sides.\n",

      "textContent--->Education Vietnam is developing country, therefore there are many problems emerged in society such as air pollution, overloaded transportations, the decline of infrastructure qualities.. etc but I think the most urgent matter, which the goverment has to deal with is the lack of housing for students Every years, at the begining of July, there are thousands of students come to Ha Noi, the capital city of Vietnam, attending to the unniversity examinations. They mostly come from  red rive delta region or central coast. They bring with them the expectations of families, friends, teachers. They have no idea about front challenges. First of all, it is housing problem The severe lacks of housing for students can be reffered as the percentage of the number's students in doorm above the number's students in total. This statistic is less then 30%. Therefore, 70% of students has to find accommodations by themselves. As a certain result, most of their accommodations are dirty, unsecure and extremely faraway from the unniversities.( In Ha Noi, the major of number's universities are located in centre, the price of rent estate very high compared to student's income). This nightmare will not ends until the day they'd graduate, work, marry and have their own children, except they'd get the huge financial support from their families. Workers have also encounted the same situation. This problem has been exitting for many years. But Recently, I've heard from the public media, one of the goverment's spokeman said\" will move the metropolitan unniversities to the suburbs\". I do not know how longer it becomes true. Now,we have to wait\n",
      "textContent--->toelf writing \"We should not judge people by their external appearances\" I absolutely agree with this and I guess you have the same idea. That is because two main reason. First, human being is a very special one. You and I have many respects to consider not only external appearances. If you judge me just by my external appearances, you will never understand me even we are never friend. Second, the most important thing people have is human dignity not appearances. It is too wrong to judge people by appearances. You can be misleading by attractive faces, but maybe they are killer. Some people, however, are so ugly, they are admired by their prestige. For instance Truong Vo Diem, Bao Chuan… Inclusion, the first statement is always true because of that two reason. You should be careful when judge people.\n",

      "textContent--->Western comic vs Japanese manga Another paragraph writing. I'm doing my best to improve my writing skill, so I really aprreciate your comment on word choice, grammar, etc. anything that you think it's not okay. Thank you! Western comics and Japanese mangas have major differences in art style, book format and creating process. First, manga drawing tends to exaggerate people’s appearances with rather big eyes, unique hairstyle and exceptional clothes. On the contrary, comics have a realistic style, making the characters look as much like real people as possible. Second, all of mangas’ pages are black and white, whereas comic books are printed in color. Third, despite a few number of assistants, mangakas (mangas’ authors) do most of the work themselves, including constructing the plot and drawing. Conversely, lots of people are involved in the manufacturing process of the comics-writer, colorist, inker, penciler to name a few. In conclusion, regardless of those contrarieties, both mangas and comics are doing a very good job at entertaining people from all over the world.\n",

      "textContent--->Eating custom in my country Customs in the world are the great and unique field to find out. Each country has a original custom which can not be confused with others. In VietNam, eating custom was evaluated mixed and special. VietNam is the country has long history and mixed custom. Many years ago, this country was colonised by China, France, Japan and America. That is the reason which created the complex eating custom in VietNam. In capital, the popular eating custom in public is in the market. Market has a great deal of stocks with many kinds of good, on the other hand, it is the place which gather small restaurants. The common structure of these restaurants are built without roof or wall, they look like tents with big tables and seats inside. But, they're favourite places for women to discuss family talks. In some formal places, people eating in big, glamorous restaurant like western countries. When going home, they eat with family and talk about social news. Eating custom in VietNam is very special. The most different thing in eating custom is always included 3 meals and lunch, dinner are the important meals in a day. Meals in VietNam have to have rice, soup and some dishes. They don't like food have origin from industry. Natural food is more acceptable and favourite.\n",

      "textContent--->The best way of getting round Hanoi Hanoi is a noisy city with busy streets. The traffic is terrible especially in rush hour. So I think using bus is the best way of getting round the city. First of all, travelling by bus is cheap. You only have to pay a small amount of money for buying ticket instead of a big amount of money for gasoline (if you use a motorbike). It was even cheaper if you were a commutation ticket holder. In comparison with travelling by motorbike, travelling by bus is much cheaper. Furthermore, if you travel by bus, you don't have to wait in line to buy a parking ticket or pay a fine because you went through a red light, or were riding without a safety helmet, too. As a student, I think using the bus as daily means of transport is a good way to save money. Secondly, I think travelling by bus is safe. When you use the bus, you can avoid accidents. As you know, a large number of people get into motorbike accidents every year. A lot of people even die or are seriously injured in the accidents. I used to see some terrible bike accidents so maybe travellling by bus is safer. In addition, many people feel safer when travel by bus where there are lots of people. Anyway, it is not a good idea to go to everywhere alone. Finally, travelling by bus helps to protect your health. The traffic in rush hour is so terrible, it make everyone tired. Traffic dirt and dust is make you feel suffocated. Therefore, it's a good idea to take the bus to avoid damaging your health. Besides, when the weather is bad - too hot or too cold - choosing the bus for travelling is sensible. For example, in winter, even if you wear lots of layers of clothes, gloves, wool hat, you will probably catch a cold, sneeze, get a runny nose if you ride bike a long way. Sometimes, the bus is not on time and you have to wait at the bus stop for a long time. The bus can be also be very crowded. But now, I think the bus service is improving, getting better, safer. So I think using bus is the best way of getting round the city.\n",

      "textContent--->prison health care Prisoner’s health care service has approached way so high than the Californian’s. California government has spent billions of dollars providing better health care for those that have broken the rules than for the thousands of innocents who can’t afford insurance. “States spend 10 percent of their corrections budgets on average to cover the cost of inmate health care – a total of over $3 billion annually,” Sunny Kaplan proclaims. (Kaplan) For example, On September 18, 1995, Horacio Alberto Reyes-Camarena, 47 year old murderer who killed 18-year-old, deserved a kidney transplant which cost the state an additional $100,000, so that he would be able to stay healthy until the date of his execution. Before of his kidney transplant the state of Oregon pays $121,000 a year to keep him on dialysis (Robinson). What makes government pay for this cost is because of the correctional institutions. “Correctional institutions are legally required to provide the same medical care to prisoners as that available to the public— including preventative care, care for chronic conditions, and mental treatment” (Sonle). However, it is negligible for the state to be paying for such outrageous procedures to keep alive a man who has been sentence to die. California also plans spending $8 billion over the next five years to build seven advanced medical facilities for inmates throughout the state. It is not acceptable that criminals who have committed crimes worth of the death penalty receive transplants and advanced treatments ahead of others. In conclusion, health care spending per inmate rose from $7,601 per inmate in 2005-06 to $13,778 per inmate in 2007-08 – about 81 percent increase and far above the average of $4,600 spent on health care per Californian. Therefore, there are bunch of people would go bankrupt from the medical costs of fighting cancer whereas the offenders receive expensive treatment for their health. “Oncology clinics often see prisoners get life-saving medical treatment while turning away other people who could not get treatment because their insurance wouldn’t pay for it. Prisoners don’t have to worry that” (Stancliff). How pathetic that the Supreme Court will mandate health insurance for prisoner, and not the hard-working people of this nation who pay taxes. California budgets are used to pay for prisoner’s health care rather than for Californian’s health care and education. “State Attorney General Jerry Brown told the press the court receiver’s proposal was ‘the most extravagant proposal for prison health care we’ve ever seen in the United States’” (Stancliff). Keeping prisoner healthy is the top of the government’s considered even though this offender has made our society dangerously situation. Hence, California is suggested as a highest state of the prison healthcare cost. Moreover, the $13,778 health-care-per-inmate cost is just for the general offenders, and the cost will probably get higher when the prisoners get older.\n",

      "textContent--->After a fieldtrip The one-day fieldtrip at Hoa An center was not long but what I received from it is remarkable. In fact, traveling broadens one’s horizons. The fieldtrip has well done its objectives. Firstly, I learnt to keep discipline. The fieldtrip regulations were not too strict; we have grown closer and been more sticked together. I was also assumed at discovering my friends and instructors in their different interesting appearances out of class. However, it did not mean that we could ignore the discipline. Obeying laws, following the schedule, and being self-responsible, something like that, are required for a fieldtrip. Besides, I was told many attractive stories about the nature. Over half of 5-kilometer tour around the center was with interminable forests of cajuput, bamboo, eucalyptus… That sounds like an adventure, but over all was the feeling in company and mix with the nature. Until then I did not know that fearful subjects as leeches, terrestrial leeches, snakes… are signs of pure nature that is no chemical, insecticide; and water hyacinth is sign of non-alum water. There are many kinds of cajuput, and the eucalyptus has another nice name “khuynh diep”, more and more I cannot list all. However, I could do ensure that, the air I breathed was perfectly “pure”. I also learnt the lesson of environment and saving. Muck, water hyacinth can be the important materials for Biogas system, so that necessary fuel is produced for sorts of other activities. The farming system VACBRRR is another great surprise. There are things seem useless can be salvaged effectively. That helps limit harmful consequences to the environment. In other words, according to the instructors that is “stable development”. The center also creates employment for farmers around, trains them for seed rice, pure vegetables. Finally but not least, I gained the lesson about hearts of people there. Their hearts beat for the nature, for the alum agriculture, and for other people. That really makes sense.\n",

When she was young, she had a round face, a fair complexion and a long black hair. At present, my mother is 51 year old. But she looks much older than the other women at the same age.

Because it sounds good to me. Firstly, as a marketing researcher,I will have chance to meet many people. Different people have different characters,different jobs, different likes and dislikes.... So,dealing with various people will enable me to increase my communication skill,have the general point of view,and access to new trends of public. And my other reason is the open working environment. This seems really interesting. I am an out-going girl, I love working on my own,and setting my schedule by my self. So open working environment really sounds good to me. I can work at any time,with any one I like. In addition,doing research market,I can travel a lot. Traveling help me understand much more about the world, enjoy various wonders and sight-seeings... It is really great,isn't it?? In my opinion,doing research the market is an ideal job. How about you???\n",

They are just students and both of them can sing very well. I've known this band through a clip on Youtube. In that clip, the drummer, also the main singer sang with the 12 voices of 12 Vietnamese singers. He was a talented mimicker. This clip also made his band very well known after a short time. Then they became a professional band performing in many shows. They not only covered songs but also composed a few ones to sing. Their songs is really nice. The lyrics is meaningful and belong to the daily life. The melody is mellow in acoustic style. I love to hear them singing live. It makes me feeling so peaceful.

      "textContent--->Essay : Why do you want to study in United States? How have you prepared or planned to prepare yourself to achieve that goal? Studying in the United States has been my dream since I was a kid. Because the US was a wonderful country in my immature eyes. I have never been to the US. I just see that country on TV. When I was young, I have seen the US many times through the movies and TV programs. And I was amazed at the tall buildings, the light bulbs, and the high technology. I wished to set foot on the Statue of Liberty, White House, Disneyland, and other famous places in the US. I determined to come to the US someday. But the dream of a child did not stop there. When I studied at secondary school, I  realized that schools in Vietnam were not ideal study environment. Most schools have old facilities and no modern equipment, some lack laboratory instruments. Education in Vietnam is too heavy on theory, lacking practical and inactive. In each lesson, every knowledge is spoke by the teacher, then students write down. Students must study so hard, with the schedule of five periods a day, and six-day school week. There are up to 12 compulsory subjects at school. Study a lot, but educational efficiency is not high. Vietnamese students are only taught the knowledge in books, and not trained the life skills. Extracurricular activities are also not attached special importance. No sports, no clubs, no entertainment. I need something different, more active, more practical, and more importantly I can learn more than what are in the textbooks. So I want to study abroad in high school. I think high schools in the US would be the good study environment for me. In the US, I could study at a school which has good facilities, apart from classrooms and playground, there are function rooms equipped fully such as computer room, gym, library, lab,... My study will also be better if there are experiments and models in lessons of chemistry, physics and biology. I’d love to see the experiments and models, because studying science just in theory can not be called ‘studying science’. At school I can speak my own opinions, can make questions to the teacher about what I do not understand. I can joined many outdoor activities such as camping, sports, or elective courses that I enjoy. Acting plays is my favorite, but I have never done it before, because there is not any course like this at my school. The active environment in the US can help me to learn things that I am unable to learn in Vietnam. For instance, I can practice public speaking ability, creative thinking, social skills,..., and learn how to handle unexpected situations. The main curriculum does not take too much time so I can do other things like part-time job or a volunteer work. Moreover, I want to experience an independent life. I have grown, and I need to learn how to live without parents. My father is always thinking that I can’t take care of myself. I want to prove to my parents that I can do everything well without care of them, even in a foreign country. I will cook, do laundry, clean the house by myself. Living in the US also lets me know more about American culture, people and geography. I could welcome Halloween, Christmas, Thanksgiving,..., which are no or not important in Vietnam. I will go to the places where I am yearning to come, so that I realize my childhood dream. To be able to study abroad in the US, the most important is English. I began studying English when I was 7. Although until now my English is still not good, I am trying to improve it. Apart from English, I also studied science subjects well at secondary school. Besides, in order to live alone in a foreign country I need to learn to take care of myself, do housework as well as preparing psychology and the ability to cope alone. Fortunately, I determinded to study abroad for a long time, so I have enough confidence to experience an independent life. I believe that I can do it. About finance, my family has not much money for me to study abroad, but I will try to gain a scholarship. Now my plan is study English, then take a scholarship examination to be able to study in the US next year. This was my essay to attend Vietabroader conference in July ^^!\n",

      "textContent--->A nightmare holiday Last summer holiday my family travrled to Haiphong,a north-east coast city of Vietnam. We stayed in a guest house which just some dozens of steps to be able to reach the foot of a 200-metre hill. It was getting darker. Just several minutes later,dark night gradually covered th whole ground. It began raining sporadicly. It was not merely an day-ending rain as usual in summer. That was a storm. It rained harder and harder. Raindrops were much bigger than normal. The wind blew severely so that even long-standing trees were eradicated out of the ground . Blowing wind sounded as the grunt of a herd of wolfs. Flood water current ran from th etop of the hill down to the lower like a stream. It dug up rocks,soils along its way and swept them away. The lightning flared up in the dark sky,the thunder bursted out roarly outside the house. All people were frightend ,some of children were crying. Suddenly,the lights in the house came out. All things surrounding us only were a black curtain. Still it continued raining harder. Leafs fell scatterly in the wind. The strong wind beat repeatedly into the glass windows. A big explosion alongside an electric current passed by the house within few seconds. Luckily, no one was injured . Windows were broken into small pieces and the whole house was shaked slightly. We were really bewildering. The only thing we could do was to sit in silent for fright. I heard clearly heart-beats and hurry breathness. I've never been in such tense situation. I felt that a horrible thing is coming. But,fortunately,the rain was decreasing little by little. The wind was becoming calm. No longer thunder and no longer lightning. The storm was woken. And the lights came back. Everybody shouted happily and cheered . We didn't dare going out of the house. But,it was certain that almost things outside were deystroyed by terrible rage of the flood water flow. It was a horrible nightmare in my real life instead.\n",

Some scientists believe that in the future further advances in medical science may push like expectancy even further. In my opinion, cause of increasing life-span in developed countries thanks to economic development, good knowledge of nutrition and improvements in public health measures, medicine technology. Firstly, the major factor, accounting for increasing life-span, in developed countries economy so the government focus on the quality of people’s life. Furthermore, they create more social welfare for citizen in order to make their citizen comfortable psychology and live happier and longer. Secondly, understanding of people about nutrition is better. They know that nutrition plays a major role in keeping their healthy. So they eat in moderation and have adequate meals. Finally, in developed countries people enhance knowledge of public health measures and early detect a symptom of disease in order to treat thoroughly. Therefore, medical technology advances, they benefit in ways that lead to less biochemical damage to the complex machinery of their body. Tomorrow I have to send my teacher this essay.

While they are different in many way, they have also have several  similarities. This report will compare and contrast the location, size , population and climate feature of the two cities. Firstly, the location feature of the cities differ. Beijing is in nort-eastern China and at the north tip of the North China Plain. Moreover, it is about 60 km north west of the port Tianjin. On the other hand, Ha Noi is the head of the Red River delta and 140 km far from the South Sea China. Secondly, another important difference between the two cities is their size and population. While Ha Noi is only 921 sq km, Beijing is 16,808  sq km in area. Vietnamese, majorly with the biggest minorities of  Chinese and Hmong, make up the 4,100,000 population in Ha Noi. However, Beijing has a population of approximately 15,244,000 with 96 percent Chinese Han. Finally, there are similarities and differences in the climates of the two cities. Both have  low temperatures in January and high temperatures in July, but Ha Noi is always hotter than Beijing. In addition,Ha Noi is tropical-mosoonal, whereas Beijing is conential-monsoonal. Therefore, Ha Noi 's average annual rainfall is more than Beijing's. Ha Noi has four seasons : the summer is hot, the winter is cold, the spring is warm and the autumn is cool. However, Beijing has  two seasons : the summer is hot and humid and the winter is cold and dry. Furthermore, it is clear ,cool and pleasant from mid September to mid October.\n",

Buying a good product in not easy at all. When you have demand for goods,which feature do you attract first?Maybe the quality,the price,or the style. As for me,I have much care about the quality. And if you choose shopping online you needn't bother about it. You only have to type the key word,the name of the product,and there will be a list of that product with all necessary information. The goods come from many different producers and manufacturers all over the world. So you will have many choices. You can compare the one with the others to find out the best. When shopping online,you can buy a product with suitable price. It sounds really great. The price of the product is very various due to the quality and the brand name. Each product has a price tag,which is issued by the producer so you are not afraid of bad bargain. Additionally,the services attach to shopping online are very good. With a computer you can buy whatever you want at home instead of going out. Nowadays,with the greater advance in technology,internet enable people to do many thing at home,these including shopping. Shopping online makes you feel comfortable and save much time. Once you make a decision about the product,the supplier will deliver it to your own house as soon as possible. If you can't make a choice yet,you can get advices from the suppliers. Now what do you think about shopping online?With these advantages I believe that you will change your mind.

Then they spread on outside and inside of  the duck a kind of thick liquid, which contain honey, soy sauce, maltose… to create a water brown yellow. Duck’s belly has been stuffed with many spices. The second step is slightly roasting the stuffed duck on ember until the duck’s color changes from yellow to dark brown, it’s cooked. When eating roast duck, locals never use fish sauce or soy sauce. They have their own special sauce that was prepared for the roast duck. That is the water take from the belly of cooked duck. If roast duck doesn’t have this sauce, it’s not a tasty dish anymore.\n",
      "textContent--->Confident Confident is a important characteristic to get sucsess. But it's not true that when you need confident, you will have it. What characteristics of a person who have confident? I think one of they is good knowledge. When you know well at something, that means you know how will loss, and the ways to win, so you will have confident. Experience is also necessery. When you praticed and get sucess at a task many times, you will properly have confident to do it one more time. So, how to have confident? I think some people, when they were borned, they had confident. Althought they don't know something well, they don't care about it. They always believe that they can do it, so they do it with comfort, no pressure. It's very good. But almost other are not such people. They only have confident when they had effort, they were hard-working, so they knew it well or they did it many times. There are tasks, however, that you can't try it. You only have a chance to do it. For example, when I took an exam for FPT university, I have not ever do such exam before. In this case, it's more difficult to have confident. There is more way to have confident is \" no comparing with other one\". I thinks comparing sometimes it's good, but sometimes it's also bad. For example, when you and some your friends do the same task. If you compare you to other one, you think you are the best student in this group, I'm sure that you will have confident and finally you finish it early. But oppositly, if you believe you are the bad student in this group, you always think that if everyone can't do it, there would be no reason you can do it. Finally, you will loss. For that reason, I think no compering with other people. In my class, the best students are who have confident. I also want to have confident but I am always hard-working to have it.\n",

When I  decided to study at A, I studied  courses carefully to make a right one which suitable for my ability and my indulgence. Each course has its own features. However, BA (Hons) Business and Management Studies Programme is always my first choice. Firstly, I really be interested in Business and Management since I was in high school. Secondly, I think it seems to be scientific subject of improving people’s  thought and virtue, not only training people who are good at earning money and  the knowledge of Business and Management helps me control finance, time, especially myself to reach  proposed goals. Thirdly, the knowledge of this brings to me unlimited opportunities. I can work for companies or big corporations in Vietnam or other countries after graduating. In addition, the studying time at A will help me establish relationships with my classmates, former students and lecturers and that relationships are helpful for developing my career in the future. Fourthly, in my opinion, studying  Business and Management is effective investment because the jobs belong to this subject seems  to be easier to find than others. Finally,I believe that my skills and knowledge that I am studied in this subject  not only be useful  for my career but also contribute something to society or my country. That are the reasons why I choose this course for my studying at A.\n",

      "textContent--->some customs of Vietnamese^^ hello everybody, today I want to talk about some customs of Vietnam when you come here for first time. if you visit your friend's home, you should know somethings you should do or not. firstly, when you meet my parents (just for examples) or adult, you should fold your arms, make your bow (maybe just a little bow) and say \"xin chào mọi người\" like \"hello everybody\" in English. Because it shows respect and it's very polite, or you can shake hand, but do not hug and kiss because Vietnamese isn't used to hugging or kissing for greeting. They will be shy or embarrass, or maybe they feel a little impoliteness. Next, in the dinner, people often use chopsticks for eating, not knives of forks or hands, so you should learn how to use chopsticks for eating. and a note is important to remember is you should say something like \"have a good appetite\" before you eat. because it shows your respect to everyone and make people feel appitite. And now Lunar New Year is upcoming, you should prepare \"lucky money\" to give or \"lixi\" children. that will bring lucky for people and for you in the new year. Inaddition, those are traditional greetings like \" live up to 100 years\" or \" security, good health and prosperity\" or \" may money flow in like water\"... In other hand, when you want to give someone a present, especially your lover, remember, donot give a handkerchief, beause handkerchief means \"goodbye\". there  are a lot of things to talk about Vietnamese culture, hope you enjoy it! \" HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!\"\n",
      "textContent--->Sexual attraction I've just watched  an interesting TV show and I want to share it with you. It talked about sex attraction. On the other word, it discussed reasons why one man and one woman attracted each other. For example,, have you ever been mesmerised by a flamboyant person? At least, you've impressed by his/her dazzling display of talent. You're not the special case . Women are attracted by power, or you can define it is an attractive man being a noticeable one. Perhaps you think this is stupid and it sounds strange, but in conclusion, instinctively, all we need in sex relationship is desire to have a healthy baby. That's the fact. To do this, we always find a healthy genome which is shown in appearances. In an experiment, scientists designed a computer program that allow men who took part in  would change the image of a woman as he wanted. That meant they could adjust size of woman's body as the perfect woman on their mind. The result was quite surprising: It's not big breasts as many might suppose, but it's the ratio between the hips and the waists. The reason was that ratio was a tribute to good fertility. As men, they instinctively knew that, without consciousness. What about women? As I told, they are so impressed by powerful men. In prehistoric times, on the process of revolution, men replaced women to play the major role in family . The most healthy one would become the leader of the clan. His elite social position prove his best gene. That's rather simple reason!\n",
      "textContent--->The movie What kind of film  do you like? I love action films. Yesterday, I saw a terrific film named “Transporter 1”. It is the first film in a series also consisting of “Transporter 2” and “Transporter 3”. The film is about a highly skilled driver named Frank known only as \"The Transporter\". He will transport anything without any question. He  has three rules which he never breaks: never change the deal, don’t care who the employer is for or what is being transported, never look in the package. He has been hired to transport three bank robbers. Frank is then hired to deliver a package to an American gangster. Complications arises when he breaks one of his rules and finds the package is really a woman. The main character is that  really handsome star Jason Statham. He was well-known for his roles in crime films: \"Revolver\",\"Snatch\". He looked fantastic with his muscles and perfect body build. His acting is wonderful, too. It was wonderful to see him on the movie, fighting , driving his car on street. You must see how skillful he drives his car to escape the chasing of police. The film concluded with lots of car chasing scenes. The producer maybe used lots of special effects to increase the intensity of these scenes. For example, the scene that the missiles hit Frank 's house was fascinating. The music was not very appropriate,though. I think the music was not good for that kind of movie. But it really wasn't a problem. I hope the next part of series is better. I think whoever loves action films will agree with me that the film is worth watching. If you are a fan of action films, you should see it.\n",

I was practicing my Spoken English all this afternoon in the library by myself. I went to the fourth floor because there were few people,and I found an empty room easily. I have typed the words out in the morning. I followed my mobile phone to read the sentence one by one. At first,I found it a little difficult,because I met many new words with meanings I couldn’t understand. There were many person’s names which I couldn’t speak them out correctly,they were so hard to pronunce. Then,it occurred the ideal to give up in my mind. But I get rid of it quickly. So I continued my work until four o’clock. There are no classes tomorrow afternoon,so I will practice my Spoken English continuely. I will never say give up.\n",

This proverb is do true under several situations. First, If we have promised to keep a secret, then keep silence and never speak out. Second, If  we don't understand on one thing, please don't make any comment on it. The more we talk the more mistake we'll make. Finally when what we are talking may hurt others or invade their privacy we'd better not do that. Nevertheless, there are also some exceptions. If we are very sure what we'll talk are right and don't hurt anyone. Don't hesitate to do it. What's more, if our words can help others. Then don't mean your words. In a word, we can draw the conclusion that \"silence is gold\" is a truth but not always, We should learn to speak the proper words at the proper place in proper time.\n",

      "textContent--->  the English Essay Writing Class No one can deny that we can learn many things from the English Essay Writing Class even though someone may do not like it. Some people complain that it is boring and difficult. Furthermore, it wastes us so much time. To some extents they are not wrong, but personally I would like to say: I like the English Essay Writing Class as it is very beneficial and interesting. As we all know, we can gain many benefits from the English Essay Writing Class. First of all, we learn how to organize our sentences logically. As logic is to essay, as oil is to machine. Each essay need a theme to go through and organize what you want to express logically. Second, we can review and consolidate what we have learned before. We have not used words in essay so exact until did we write the assignment by Mr. fan. Although it took us so much time to look up the dictionary to find the exact meaning and usage of each word, it really help us to mater the language. For example, which word should we choose when we want to express one person walks so slowly for pleasure? Saunter? Stroll? Wander? They all mean “walk”, but there are a little difference among them. The saunter means to walk in an unhurried way and usually in a confident manner. The stroll means to walk a short distance, slowly and lazily, probably for pleasure. Meanwhile the wander means to walk though an area without aim. Though looking up the dictionary, we can tell the subtle difference among these words and use them better in the essay. The third one is to appreciate the excellent prose, poems and other essays, what is more , we can improve our writing level by imitation. Except that I have mentioned in the previous chapter, I also like the teaching mode and spirit of our teacher. In stead of traditional mode, some other ways are used by Mr. fan such as some lectures online, teaching DVD, introduction of some dictionaries and websites. In stead of having class just in classroom, there is the blog which is set up by Mr. fan himself for us to learn at pastime. For example, we can find many teaching skills, writing skills, beautiful essay as well as information which we want to know. Most of all, I like the teacher, Mr. fan, whose story enough me. I am a student who English is not good from section B. My oral and basic English is poor, let alone my writing. I am so worried about it. But I realized that why Mr. fan can do while I can’t since I heard about the story of Mr. fan. And it is the driving force to push me move on. I do not know how to express my gratitude for Mr. fan. Follow what he sad, do what he told and complete what he ordered is the only thing I can do to repay. And I believe I will be better and better under instruction from him. At last, I hope Mr. Fan can give us some personal advices before corrected our essay for the difference between our English level. If we know where we make mistakes and the reason why we make such mistakes, we can avoid these mistakds next time. Just as the proverb: Fall into a pit, gain into a wit. Right?\n",

      "textContent--->Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A job with more vacation time is better than a job with high salary but less vacation time. The issue whether people should choose a job with a high salary or more vacation time is a topic that is often discussed and there are differing opinions about this issue. Some prefer to have a high salary, because they could buy some things that they like most, while others would choose a job with more vacation time for enjoying themselves. In my view, I prefer to have a job with more vacation time instead of a high salary for several reasons. Admittedly, earning money is one of the aims of our work. No one could deny the fact that money could not only maintain our daily lives but also could help us to achieve some of our personal goals, such as buying a car, living in a big house or helping those who live in poverty or starvation. Making money will enable us to improve our living environment and quality, and therefore getting a job with a high salary, is significant to us. However, others go into rapture at mere notion of getting money, however having a job with a high salary, is less useful than many people believe. People, who are addicted to a high income, have to spend more time working or staying in the office, and as a result, it is impossible for them to devote enough time and energy in communicating with family members. Moreover, it is difficult to develop and cultivate their children’s character and interpersonal skills and they may become more solitary and even suffer from certain emotional or psychological problems. Therefore, it is undesirable to hanker for a high salary instead of staying with family members. Furthermore, the majority of people believe that having more vacation time will provide them additional opportunities to broaden their horizons, which may put them in a favorable position prove their situation. As we know, traveling can allow us to actually meet different cultures, which we could not get from textbooks or classrooms. As an architect, although he could learn about masterpieces from the internet and magazines, the feeling of touch of the actual buildings, such as the Sydney Opera house, is totally different， We could find abundant information about the plans, sections and elevations, but we could not recognize the size, the space or the material. Having vacation time and traveling could provide us with an opportunity to realize the dream and therefore almost all of us benefit from vacation time. Therefore, I am firmly convinced that having a job with more vacation time, will bring about a profound impact on families, the person himself and even the society as whole.\n",

      "textContent--->Bad Day of Ambulation Street Now I also do remmeber what happened on the day clearly. Because my cellphone was stolen on that evening. On the afternoon, my friends and me went to the ambulation street and found a restaurant for eating. There were so many peoples that a big table was surrounded by us. All of us were so happy and we all forgot which time it was,and we didn't finish our dinner before 21:00. After eating,we said goodbye to each other. On my way school,a friend of me were talking about everything which was interseting. Maybe I was so cheerful that I didn't care anything,including wallet,cellphone and other precious things. Suddenly,the friend asked me to buy a piece of waterpelon for her,I promised her immediately and then I was about to open my backbag and took some money. To be surprised,I found my bag was opened by others! Fortunately,my wallet hadn't gone. After a while,I want to know the time,so I was just like what usual I do,to see the clock of cellphone.

I believed that my cellphone was left in the restaurant by me not stolen by thief,but after a period of asking,I admited the fact that my cellphone was stolen. After arrivaled dormitory I thought that If I hadn't gone to the ambulation street my cellphone would not lost. Because of the accident,I have made a decision that I won't go out for playing,unless I have specia thing have to do. At the same time,I think those thieves' behaviour is immoral.\n",
      "textContent--->Chinese Good Men There are four classmates, including me,  living in the dormitory. One of us is a pure and crazy businessman, he always cuts his classes days without any reasonable excuses. I think it's full of ideas of how to earn money from the large amount of students and start his enterprise in his mind. The second one is me, who is not a good student either. Once I was given make-up exams twice by the teachers, what's worst, I also cut my school days many times. I am the one who is relatively focus on the efficient way of dealing with things. There are so many old regulation rules in our life, which are really inefficient and boring. As the society development, we young men need some dynamic ways to enrich ourselves. Let us get to the point, the education we are having is mostly for getting a college diploma. I don't know if it's a truth, but the performance of many university students and someone's saying do show me that reality. I don't care much about what's it but to seek what is valuable for me. Now, to be honest, now my mind is full with all kinds of ideas of how to develop myself and go a further and successful way in life. Yeah, both two guys mentioned above are not common students. What're the common and good students? According to the traditional and social views, they are used to doing what people had done and try their best to have a good job for them. Anyway, how should I define the \"good student\"? In my opinion, we should do well in the traditional study efficiently as soon as possible, and then we can do something what interest us. The style of teaching nowadays should be reformed, at least it's necessary and better for our university. I don't know what the situations are in other university in China. Anyway, the rest of two roommates, so-called the \"Chinese good men\" I said , are very good for girls. Yeah, one has a girlfriend, and the other hasn't. Both of them are very care for their girls. They are good at cooking, making delicious soup in particular. Do you know, what's the pop boyfriend in our life? I would like to tell you that they are handsome, excellent, rich and so on. We know those are the main factor of some girls' choice of boyfriend. So, there are few of guy can be so good in this materialistic times. Maybe the word of \"good\" is not good enough to describe them, due to my poor vocabulary. They are so precious that I am very proud of them, and I should learn from them in some ways,lol!! The last but not least, I should mention that the first guy and I are just not care enough for girls. If I may say so, I think we are going to follow the pop style of boyfriend, if we aren't aware of that issues. Today, there was tempting smell of soup full of our room. Wow, I was dying when I smelt it, what a delicious soup it was! But unfortunately, the soup is only for his girl. Oh, what a pity!! Haha.......\n",

Secondly, I do not strive for this test wholeheartedly by virtue of the preparation of Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 3 as well as GRE.

However, I payed a bad role of breaking my student’s dream last sunday. Since I had went into university I have been doing part-time work as a tutor at weekends. My student employeed me early days in september to instructe her to learn instead the supplyment classes. As all of the students who have tutors in their families, she was in the hope that a tutor will be enable her to succeed in the national universities admission examination,which will be held on 7th,june,next year. I had been to her home 6 times in total before last Sunday. I have to admitted that she had been doing a hard work those two months. While, because two years had sliped from her hands,she had been left far away behind her classmates in accademy. There was no any progress she had made after two monthes hardship and ,at the same time she was getting impatient for only 7 monthes  left for preparing the test. Though,she was still stick to her dream that she will succeed. To be honest,the time is too short for her to pass it. There will be some possibilities for her to succeed on 7th, june, 2012. ting on a sudden impulse, told her what I had thought in my heart and advised her to prepare the examination in 2012. I didn’t see her face lit up any longer. Consequently, I was fired. I was too selfish to take her feeling when her dream was broken into account and hurt her heart. It is a good lesson and I would remember it immortally. It will serve as a impressive remind of I should be more skillful when I express my opinion to others. Above all, I have no access to break anyone else’s dream, whatever the situation is.\n",

      "textContent--->Abstract of my paper The trend of the study of Daoism in ancient Japan recently can be divided into two aspects. One is continuing to indicate what elements of Daoism have been absorbed by ancient Japan. It consciously tried to provide more arguments on how these elements entered and have affected Japan than related studies of last period. The other is to explain why Japanese envoys to Tang turned down the request of sending Daoist to Japan made by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in 753. These two sides seem self-contradiction as they show that Daoism was rejected by Japan officially and meanwhile, many elements of Daoism existed in ancient Japan. Shimode Sekiyo once figured out the kind of Daoism practiced in ancient Japan is Folk Daoism (Shimode, 1974:226). But in fact, it could not interpret the elements of Daoism also founded at the official level. In this paper, I want to make the overall picture of Daoism in ancient Japan more clearly. I focus on the understanding of Daoism by Japanese Ritsuryō state 律令国家 and the founder of the Shingon 真言, Kūkai空海(774-835), as the two subjects both have shown their understandings of Daoism as a whole religion. Japanese Ritsuryō state regarded Daoism as the religion representing Tang Dynasty and thought the content of Daoism was the methods of Daoist master道士法. The result is that it tried to keep Daoist master from Japan and proscribed the methods of Daoist master in non-governmental circles. Kūkai considered Daoism as techniques toward immortality in his book Sangō shiiki 三教指帰 and chose Buddhism as his belief finally. The common point of the two understandings of Daoism is there isn’t core divinity concept of Dao but only methods, techniques of Daoism. Based on this, Daoism without Dao never really existed in Japan as its own separate, organized religion while it has an unmistakable influence on Japanese religion culture via its methods of various techniques, rites, symbols, charms and so on.\n",

      "textContent--->Internet, Not the Best Source of Information All the Time In the age of information explosion, science is developing and knowledge is renewing itself rapidly. There is no doubt that computers and the Internet have become an integral part of our daily lives. Hence, many people have grown dependent on the Internet and argue that it is the best source of information. From my perspective, the Internet is indeed very useful and convenient in many cases, but it is not always the best choice when we need to search something, especially something important. The Internet is an awesome tool when we look for some certain information, since it is convenient, cheap and easy to use. For instance, having been typed some simple words, Google Maps can give us a wise advice of how to get to a newly opened restaurant or an art exhibition in seconds, while Wikipedia is always there waiting for us to discover any amazing knowledge we do not know. Even our grandparents can do these without any troubles. And it is more exciting considering that most of the services on the Internet are free! All we need is a computer and a modem. Nevertheless, sometimes the Internet is not as perfect as we expect it to be. Information on the Internet may be fake or not so accurate because everyone can upload anything without censorship. So if you need any accurate statistics or serious and formal references, some traditional information sources like books and academic journals can be the better choices. In addition, just as we are in the era of “information explosion”, some ancient but useful information may be hidden by numerous new ones on the Internet. In this case we should put away our computers and turn to the libraries. Consequently, the Internet can be the “best” source in most situations because it is not expensive, it is easy to get used to and provide a large amount of information. But this is not always true, especially when we are in need of some specialized materials. We should treat the new favorite of our age rationally and use it in a correct way.\n",

      "textContent--->Chinese education system（1）--the early education Mister Want was curious about Chinese school system, she said she would like anything that I can tell her. As a result, I try to make a simple introduction of education system of China. All the things I said would only apply for mainland China. Every child aged seven would be sent to primary (or elementary) school, but most children start their education much younger than seven years old. They are usually sent to nursery schools because their parents don't have much time to keep an eye on their children or those parents want their children be inspired the early the better. I was sent to nursery school at eight months old since my parents were busy with their work. Nowadays, more parents consider more of the teaching quality of nursery schools, some of them may even spend quite a little money in order to send their children to an entire English-environmental nursery school. They hope their children would be able to speak native English in fluency by this way， though I don't think that works. At nursery school, children will be taught things like simple maths--add and subtract, painting, easy Chinese characters, dialogues in polite, some handwork. Before primary school, you can also enter kindergaten which help children to prepare for this step. Kindergatens will teach something more difficult than nursery schools'. In the next six years, you have to play a role as a pupil. You must learn how to be polite and studious. You must greet whichever teacher whenever you see them. You have to greet to the teacher who are going to have a class for you before start. We will gather on the playground on Mondays to hold a ceremony. We would salute during the flag raising ceremony and sing our national song after it. Then we would stand（if you are lucky enough, you are allowed to sit on the little chair that is brought by you) and listen to the principal(or schoolmaster) or other school leaders who is giving a speech. The substance of most speeches is about ethics， virtues or important news. We recieve partriotic education mostly during this period. We learn subjects named Chinese, Maths, PE， Nature and society, Labor, Art, Music， English. English won't be learned as soon as you enter the school. You may only start learning ABC in grade three or four. （It is said that English is taught since grade one now.） In my opinion, our education basically lacks of explorations or interactions. Pupils are encouraged to memorize as much  knowledage （you define those knowledge as facts) as they can instead of thinking of how to solute a problem creatively. That's why most Chinese students can often get a good mark but seldom make big achievements. We do have excellent fondational education but lack of inspirations. In the last year of primary school, a test would be given but it doesn't really matter your later education as far as you have passed. You will be at least sent to a middle school near your house which is elected by a computer randomly. Of course, if you want to control your life by yourself instead of a computer, you can spend some money to have tests of some good schools, let them decide if you are clever enough to have a seat.\n",

But It also showed the world is coming to end by 2012. This theory is repeated again and again. Some people even declaim that they've found the lost money caused by financial crisis is used to build arks in Himalayas. They also prove the theory by telling Lech Kaczynski is not dead but leading to the arks. The frequently happened earthquakes also increased the terror among the public. Lies after repeated thousand of times become truth, but the 2012 theory is repeated by millions of people time and time again. I just heard one of our patients said \"The world is going to end by 2012, that means we have at most two years to live, and why should we still work so hard? Why not give up the job, leave the desease alone and have a good time?\" I thought if we didn't stop him from leaving hospital, he would have been suiciding by never injecting insulin. I want to forbid the movie from showing, because the 2012 is no longer a movie, but a propoganda to broadcast the anti-human theory. Lots of people earn money by telling others expensive ways to survive the fanciful disaster, driving others to believe, to fear, and to give up what belong to themselves. After all I watched the movie because my fucking speaking english teacher want us to believe and even make it the exam but I hope you don't watch it.

More and more people recognize that it is very important for us to make our cities greener. With the development of the economy, the area of the city becomes larger than before. In order to get more wood, more and more trees were cut down in the past. It is not easy to find the woods around the cities. More and more buildings, which made by the concrete, founded around us. It has been the symbol of the modern society. More and more cities take part in the competition who have the highest building. But now, the things changed, more and more coutries find the import of making cities greener. In fact, we can get more benefit from the making cities greener. At first, with the develop of the economy, more and more private cars used in our cities, and they also bring us more exhaust gas and pollute our environment,  but the green plants can absorb and decompose the pollution. The second, the green is good for us to reduce the pressure. And the green makes our cities more beautiful.\n",

However, none of them made fun of any other. I didn't know why; maybe they were so anxious about the TEM4 that they forgot anything else even if it was something very funny. Since nobody was in mood in doing any mischief, I also put it aside and focused on my own business. After my professional class, I attended the class named the Theory of Education. The couse itself is dull while the teacher is more boring. Today there were few people turned up in his class, which annoyed him a lot, so he called attendance. You know students are afraid of this kind of stuff because it relates to their final grade. Fair enough, since they did not come, the teacher wanted to revenge by cut down their points, which can give them a warn. Well, I didn't like the techer neither especially today. He was talking something that I hate or I have no interest in. So I just kept reading my own novel or chatting with my online friend. Finally the class was over. As you know every Friday, I have to teach as a voluntary teacher. This after-noon. I went to the school again with my team members. The moment we got there, we were surrounded by the children as if they haven't seen us for a long time and missed us a lot . I don't know whether they are, but I want to tell you tha t I was happy today. I taught them music. Most of them were quiet and concentrative on what I said in the class. Since we decided to take record of their behavior in the class as an evidence to show their hardworking. They were soft and resonble than before, which made the class easier to move on. I got a cold and had sore throat so it was a bit difficult for me to speak loud in the class. Fortunately, they were not noisy so that everything went on well. After two classes, our task was finished so we went backe to our campus. After I got changed my dress, I went to jog as usual. I felt very tired but I still finished ten laps. I do think it really require our persistence and patience. Tomorrow is Saturday, but we still have make-up class. Because we are going to have the so called QingMing festival, on which day family members get together and go to their ancestors' tombs to commemorate them ans show their love and miss for them. Since we are far away from home, what we are going to do is stay at where we are or go out have fun with our friends. Well, I stil have some homework to do. Let's call it a day.\n",

      "textContent--->Chapter 9  How to Avoid Arguments One of the most difficult challenges in our loving relationships is handling differences and disagreements. Often when couples disagree their discussions can turn into arguments and then without much warning into battles. Suddenly they stop talking in a loving manner and automatically begin hurting each other : blaming, complaining, accusing, demanding, resenting, and doubting. Men and women arguing in this way hurt not only their feelings but also their relationship. Just as communication is the most important element in a relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element, because the closer we are to someone, the easier it is to bruise or be bruised. --------------------------------------------------------------- Just as communication is the most important element in a  relationship, arguments can be the most destructive element. ------------------------------------------------------------------ For all pratical purposes I strongly recommend that couples not argue. When two people are not sexually involved it is a lot easier to remain detached and objective while arguing or debating. But when couples argue who are emotionally involved and especially sexually involved, they easily take things too personally. As a basic guideline: never argue. Instead discuss the pros and cons of something. Negotiate for what you want but don't argue. It is possible to be honest, open, and even express negative feelings without arguing or fighting. Some couples fight all the time, and gradually their love dies. On the other extreme, some couples suppress their honest feelings in order to avoid conflict and not argue. As a result of suppressing their true feelings they lose touch with their loving feelings as well. One couple is having a war while the other is having a cold war. It is best for a couple to find a balance between these two extremes. By remembering we are from different planets and thus developing good communication skills, it is possible to avoid arguments without suppressing negative feelings and conflicting ideas and desires. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARGUE Without understanding how men and women are different it is very easy to get into arguments that hurt not only our partner but also ourselves. The secret to avoiding arguments is loving and respectful communication. The differences and disagreements don't hurt as much as the ways in which we communicate them. Ideally an argument does not have to be hurtful; instead it can simply be an engaging conversation that expresses our differences and disagreements.(Inevitably all couples will have differences and disagree at times.) But pratically speaking most couples start out arguing about one thing and, within five minutes, are arguing about the way they are arguing. Unknowingly they begin hurting each other; what could have been an innocent argument, easily resolved with mutual understanding and an acceptance of differences, escalates into a battel. They refuse to accept or understand the content of their partner's point of view because of the way they are being approached. Resolving an argument requires extending or stretching our point-of view to include and integrate another point of view. To make this strtch we need to feel appreciated and respected. If our partner's artitude is unloving, our self- esteem can actually be wounded by taking on their point of view. ------------------------------------------------ Most couples start out arguing about one thing and ,within five minutes, are arguing about the way they are arguing. --------------------------------------------------------------------- The more intimate we are with someone, the more difficult it is objectively to hear their point of view without reacting to their negative feelings. To protect ourselves from feeling worthy of their disrespect or disapproval automatic defenses come up to resist their point of view. Even if we agree with their point of view, we may stubbornly persist in arguing with them. WHY ARGUMENTS HURT It is not what we say that hurts but how we say it. Quite commonly when a man feels challenged, his attention becomes focused on being right and he forgets to be loving as well. Automatically his ability to communicate in a caring, respectful, and reassuring tone decreates. He is aware neither of how uncaring he sounds nor of how hurtful this is to his partner. At such times, a simple disagreement may sound like an attack to a woman; a request turns into an order. Naturally a woman feels resistant to this unloving approach, even when she would be otherwise receptive to the content of what he was saying. A man unknowingly hurts his partner by speaking in an uncaring manner and then goes on to explain why she should not be upset. He mistakenly assumes she is resisting the content of his point of view, when really his unloving delivery is what upsets her. Because he does not understand her reaction, he focuses more on explaining the merit of what he is saying instead of correcting the way he is saying it. He has no idea that he is starting an argument; he thinks she is arguing with him. He defends his point of view while she defends herself from his sharpened expressions, which are hurtful to her. When a man neglects to honor a woman's hurt feelings he invalidates them and increases her hurt. It is hard for him to understand her hurt because he is not as vulnerable to uncaring comments and tones. Consequently, a man may not even realize how much he is hurting his partner and thus provoking her resistance. Similarly, women don't realize how they are hurtful to men. Unlike a man, when a woman feels challenged the tone of her speech automatically becomes increasingly mistrusting and rejecting. This kind of rejection is more hurtful to a man, especially when he is emotionally involved. Women start and escalate arguments by first sharing negative feelings about their partner's behavior and by giving unsolicited advice. When a woman neglects to buffer her negative feelings with messgaes of trust and acceptance, a man responds negatively, leaving the woman confused. Again she is unaware of how hurtful her mistrust is to him. To avoid arguing we need to remember that our partner objects not to what we are saying but to how we are saying it. It takes two to argue, but it only takes one to stop an argument. The best way to stop an argument is to nip it in the bud. Take responsibility for recognizing when a disagreement is turning into an argument. Stop talking and take a time-out. Reflet on how you are approaching your partner. Try to understand how you are not giving them what they need. Then, after some time has passed, come back and talk again but in a loving and respectful way. Time-outs allow us to cool off, heal our wounds, and center ourselves before trying to communicate again. THE FOUR F'S FOR AVOIDING HURT There are basically four stances that individuals take to avoid getting hurt in arguments. They are the four f's: fight, flight, fake, and fold. Each of these stances offers a short-term gain,but in the long run they are all counterproductive. Let's explore each of these positions. 1. Fight. This stance definitely comes from Mars. When a conversation becomes unloving and unsupportive some individuals instinctively begin to fight. They immediately move into an offensive stance. Their motto is \" the best defense is a strong offense.\" They strike out by blaming, judging, criticizing, and making their partner look wrong. They tend to start yelling and express lots of anger. Their inner motive is to intimidate their partner into loving and supporting them. When their partner backs down, they assume they have won, but in truth they have lost. --------------------------------------------------- Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship. --------------------------------------------------- Intimidation always weakens trust in a relationship. To muscle your way into getting what you want by making others look wrong is a sure way to fail in a relationship. When couples fight they gradually lose their ability to be open and vulnerable. Women close up to protect themselves and men shut down and stop caring as much. Gradually they lose whatever intimacy they had in the beginning. 2. Fight. This stance also come from Mars. To avoid confrontation Martians may retire into their caves and never come out. This passive-aggressive behavior is not the same as taking a time-out and then coming back to talk and resolve things in a more loving fashion. These Martians are afraid of confrontation and would rather lie low and avoid talking about any topics that may cause an argument. They walk on eggshells, but men do also. It is so ingrained in men that they don't even realize how much they do it. Rather than arguing, some couples will simply stop talking about their disagreements. Their way of trying to get what they want is to punish their partner by withholding love. They do not come out and diretly hurt their partners, like the fighters. Instead they indirectly hurt them by slowly depriving them of the love they deserve. By withholding love our partners are sure to have less to give us. The shor-term gain is peace and harmony, but if issues are not being talked about and feelings are not being heard then resentments will build. In the long run, they lose touch with the passionate and loving feelings that drew them together. They generally use overworking, overeating, or other addictions as a way to numb their unresolved painful feelings. 3. Fake. This stance comes from Venus. To avoid being hurt in a confrontaion this person pretends that there is no problem. She puts a smile on her face and appears to be very agreeable and happy with everything. Over time, however, these women become increasingly resentful; they are always giving to their partner but they do not get what they need in return. This resentment blocks the natural expression of love. They are afraid to be honest about their feelings, so they try to make everything \"all right, OK, and fine.\" Men commonly use these phrases, but for them they mean something completely different. He means \"it is OK because I am dealing with it alone\" or \"It's all right because I know what to do\" or \"It's fine because I am handling it, and I don't need any help.\" Unlike a man, when a woman uses these phrases it may be a sign that she is trying to avoid a conflict or argument. To avoid making waves, a woman may even fool herself and believe that everything is OK,fine, and all right when it really isn't. She sacrifices or denies her wants, feelings, and needs to avoid the possibility of conflict. 4. Fold. This stance also comes from Venus. Rather than argue this person gives in. They will take the blame and assume responsibility for whatever is upsetting their partner. In the short run they create what looks like a very loving and supportive relationship, but they end up losing themselves. A man once complained to me about his wife. He said, \"I love her so much. She gives me everything I want. My only complaint is she is not happy.\" His wife had spent twenty years denying herself for her husband. They never fought, and if you asked her about her relationship she would say \"We have a great relationship. My husband is is loving. Our only problem is me. I am depressed and I don't know why.\" She is depressed because she has denied herself by being agreeable for twenty years. To please their partners these people intuitively sense their partners's desires and then mold themselves in order to please. Eventually they resent having to give up themselves for love. Any form of rejection is very painful because they are already rejecting themselves so much. They seek to avoid rejection at all costs and want to be loved by all. In this process they literally give up who they are. You may have found yourself in one of these four f's or in many of them. People commonly more from one to the other. In each of the above four strategies our intention is to protect ourselves from being hurt. Unfortunately, it does not work. What works is to identify arguments and stop. Take a time-out to cool off and then come back and talk again. Practice communicating with increased understanding and respect for the opposite sex and you will gradually learn to avoid arguments and fights.\n",

Dear friends ,have you ever heard a legend like this：Long ago ,when god was creating the world ,he stored all his gentle in a flower ring ,and then threw it to the Indian Ocean ,tater the flower ring changed into a beautiful island ,which is now called Maldivs,a lost paradise. My friends ,can you believe there exists such an island like this：It has the most clean wave ,its has the wonderful coral reefs ,it has king-hearted inhabitants. Right ,it is Maldives—the largest coral reefs island in the world。 But according to a recent report of UN ，this beauiful island will be covered by sea water earliest in 50 years! The average altitude of Maldives is only 1 meter. That is to say ,the sea level is rising at a surprising speed of 2 cm per year! \t It is carbon dyoxide that melt the ice shelf and make the sea level rising! \t It is carbon dyoxide that makes the ocean eroder  the coral reefs little by litte. \t It is carbon dyoxide that make“lost paradise”lose for ever! \t May be there will come a day when the island′s inhabitants have to leave their hometown ,and ask all people like this: \t What  about  sunrise／What  about  rain ／Whet  about  all  the things／That  you said me were to gain We all know ,this crimal gas was stored by nature originally ,hower ,hunan beings released it is to the atmosphere!

May be you will ask:compared with a country, we seem rather small,what else can we do for our nature? \tYes, we do be really small, just like a drop of water from the ocean, But ,my friends,if we put all the drops of  water togather, they will make up of an ocean! \tUsing both sides of paper is a drop of water;recycling the waste paper is a drop of water; going school by bike instead of by car is a drop of water. But all this small drops of water getting together will make up of a large ocean! \tMy friends, to tell you what , I've dreamt a beautiful dream. \tI have a dream ,I dream that we all play on the green land of Maldives and share the blue sky. \tI have a dream ,I dream that all creatures on the earth will make friends with each other. \tI have a dream ,I dream that we breathe the fresh air and live happily together. \tSo now,what are gou waiting for ?Choose a low-carbon life and become a green person!Believe in ourselves ,Yes ,we can do it!\n",

      "textContent--->Are students nowadays less knowledgeable than before? As the internet is popular all over the world, more and more students nowadays spend more time surfing on the internet, and they prefer watching movies on DVD’s to reading the books. That is why quite a few teachers complain about students reading fewer books than before. But in my opinion, it’s not means that students today are less knowledgeable than before. First of all, the development of information technologies changes the pattern of reading. Today more and more press choose to publish e-journals and e-books, therefore students can get them easily on the internet and read on computers or cell phones. If teachers see their students sitting in front of computers, they should not worry whether the students are playing, maybe the students are reading e-books. Secondly, the internet has changed the world and leads explosion of knowledge, and people have to know more information than before that they can’t live without internet. Students can get the immediate information from the internet, while the information of the books is somehow out of date. The third concern is that it’s very convenient to get knowledge on the internet. Students can read e-book while in school or at home. That’s the reason why students don’t want take the heavy books home. In a word, I prefer that students today are more knowledgeable even though they read fewer books than before.\n",

      "textContent--->How to tell a Chinese Teacher from Foreign One \tA teacher sits on the desk while students sit causally in the classroom, then the teacher tells a joke making the whole class laugh loudly. Can you tell where the teacher comes from, China or other foreign countries? \tI think the answer is oblivious. That must be a foreign teacher. If you are curious about how I draw that conclusion, let's see the differences between the Chinese and foreign teachers. \tThe most significant difference is the targets of teaching. Usually,Chinese teachers aim at helping students learn English more efficiently and do a good job in finals,while foreign teachers' goals are encouraging students to speak English as much as possible and arousing students' interests in English. If the targets differ, what they teach definitely differs. The Chinese teachers teach students a lot of grammars, words, useful skills from the textbook and every minute in class is precious, while foreign teachers will give the students more time to speak in class and the topics are closely related to students' lives. \tThe second difference is the qualities of Chinese and foreign teachers. Chinese teachers are more familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese students,so teachers can tell them the common mistakes made by students and how to avoid in exams,while foreign teachers know little about those. But foreign teachers have a good knowledge of English culture and native sayings. Besides,the accent of a foreign teacher is much more standard,which can improve students' ability to listen and speak better. \tIn addition,the languages used by teachers differ from Foreign and Chinese teachers. Foreign teachers can only use English in teaching whereas Chinese teachers can combine English and Chinese together. Making English the only language in class can force student to pay more attention to listening. In contrast, combing two languages in teaching can make teachers fully understood but students may overly dependent on Chinese to express themselves. \tThe last difference is the result of the former aspects. The atmosphere in class differs from English and Chinese teachers. Students often feel relaxed and happy in a foreign teacher's class while in a Chinese teacher's class the situation seems more serious and students is always busying with taking notes from the blackboard. \tTo conclude, the four differences in Chinese and foreign teachers can help you understand your teachers' teaching methods. Chinese teachers and foreign teachers both have pros and cons. Your own efforts on language studying are much more important than which country your teachers come from.\n",

( p. s I am not sure whether you can understand this sentence  because I write it by the Chinese thought process.) So I hope share my joys on with you! Great sharing on language and culture,isn't it ?Ah~ha~! I live in Hong Kong and Nanjing. My native language is Mandarin. But English is also very important to me in this modern time, whether on the communication or reading,especially in Hong Kong, there are many foreign friends. I can not imagine how to communicate without English. On the other side, English is also very beautiful. I like watching the classic Movie and my favorite actress is Vivien leigh (she was so brilliant!) . I dream of writing an English essay as affluent as my Chinese essay. Someone ever told me I should recite some good essays if I really want to master it, I think I should have a try though it sounds very hard. Besides,I find that there are also many people learning Japanese in this website, which encourage me to learn Japanese too,because I fiend many traditional Chinese characters in it,That's so interesting!\n",

      "textContent--->Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman A couple of days ago I reread Tao Yuanming’s Story of Five-willow Gentleman（《五柳先生传》陶渊明 AD 365— AD 427）, which is contained in one of my junior high school Chinese textbooks. Five-willow Gentleman is one of the best- known imaginary figures in China, who is believed to be the incarnation of the poet himself. Ancient Chinese literati liked to air their opinions, values of life, dissatisfaction or grievances, not by saying them straight out, but rather through his description of somebody else and through his eulogy of that person. This Five-willow Gentleman lived in a shabby hovel, wore tattered clothes, and ate insipid food. He was once a government official, but after seeing the dark and corruptive working style of the government, he decided to quit and return to the countryside. He liked wine but was too poor to gain its access. When his old acquaintances invited him to drink, he drank to his heart’s content and got very drunk, then departed right away with scant thanks to the hosts. In the end of the verse, he was lauded as “Neither grumble about poverty, nor carve for honour and riches (不戚戚于贫贱，不汲汲于富贵)”. Yesterday when I was reading the story of Diogenes (412 or 404 BC -323 BC), he struck me as the Greek version of Five-willow Gentleman. They were both satisfied with the poorest living condition; only that Diogenes seemed to have got even closer to the extreme. He lived in a half-broken urn, wore rags hardly covering his body, sauntered in the market place, begging for food. They both acted in defiance of the mainstream of social values. Diogenes despised the masses who did not share his religion, and by no means he could endure them: he repaid their jeers with jibes and their pebbles with a shower of stones. He even took no account of Alexander the Great, when the latter condescended to visit him. While everybody else was flattering and cheering for Alexander, he simply asked him to move away for he was “blocking the sunlight”. He was so cool that Alexander said admiringly, “If I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes.” At a casual glance, Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman were really much alike. They both felt contented with their extreme poverty and their carefree lifestyle. They both cared little about sensual pleasure while focusing more on spiritual happiness. They both disdained popular social modes and values. They were both too obstinate to change themselves to fit in the society. It seemed to me that despite the intervening hundreds of years between their living times and the thousands of miles between their locations, they were actually sharing the same principle of living. However, after a closer look at their stories, I began to discern the differences between them. Underneath similar appearances lay their respective cores of qualities and values. Diogenes is one of the founders of Cynicism while Five- willow Gentleman is considered a good follower of Taoism. Having taken a cursory look, I found these two schools of philosophy find a common ground in many aspects, but a more careful observation has led me to the different roots under their seemingly same surfaces. Both Taoism and Cynicism advocate a life in harmony with nature, but their ways of seeking such a life are poles apart. Chinese Taoists find their haven in the countryside or other remote places, away from people but close to nature, whereas cynics choose somewhere prosperous and populous to live, maintaining their own stoic lifestyle, regardless of the chaotic environment and sneering eyes on them. For example, while Five-willow Gentleman settled down in the country and enjoyed the quietude, Diogenes fit himself into the nosiest city center and took all the ridicule around him as a joke. Basically Taoists are recluses and Five-willow Gentleman was just a good representative of them. Diogenes, on the contrary, belonged to the city. However, there are also Taoists living in the city but keep unaffected by the clatters and clangors of city life. Why is that? That‘s because they dream away and use their wild imagination a lot. As is shown In Tao Yuanming’s another famous poem Drinking Wine:  In  people's  haunt  I  built  my  cot; Of  wheel's  and  hoof's  noise  I  hear  not. How can it leave on me no trace? Secluded heart makes secluded place. (結廬在人境，而無車馬喧。 問君何能爾？ 心遠地自偏。 Translated by Xu Yuanchong) Chinese people tend to be Taoists instead of Confucians, due to our national character as being idle and imaginative. Except for a few who are really ambitious and work hard, the rest of us are idealists, lazy and fond of dreaming. I’ll bet Five-willow Gentleman was a dreamer too. He liked wine, and every time he had a chance to drink, he indulged himself in it, then, I guess, he would enter a beautiful dreamland, in which he melted into nature without being hounded by the reality. What about Diogenes? He was by no means a romantic, for he rejected all human desires and supported a rigorous lifestyle. I figure he dreamed naught and had no wonders at the mystic nature, contrary to Five-willow Gentleman. Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman both dislike the prevailing lifestyle at their times, nonetheless, they defied it in different ways. Five-willow Gentleman chose to hide away from people, being nonchalant about people’s strife and the nation’s crises. He kept a low profile and had no intention to heal the world by converting other people’s religions. If somebody questioned his belief or mocked his religion, he would just give an indifferent smile and said nothing back in his face, even though he might have laughed at that man’s stupidity in his mind a thousand times. That’s why he was called a “gentleman”. All in all, he just didn’t care. Diogenes, though claiming apathetic to the society, in fact was desperate to change it into his way. He wandered in the crowded market place, acted in a conspicuously weird way in the sight of almost everyone, and threw laughter and abuses at them, if they ever dared to sneer at him. To my mind, the underlying reason for his actions was his desire to show dissatisfaction with the common way of life, and to awaken the “sleeping masses”. He not only cared, but cared deeply. So, despite their similar appearances at first sight, Diogenes and Five-willow Gentleman were actually not the same. Maybe the differences should ascribe to their respective cultures. \t\n",

      "textContent--->history， learn or not learn？ Human being has come a long way in terms of finding breakthrough in incurable disease and technologies. The achievement gained from innovation and creation make people think that it would be wasteful of time to study history, because, on the surface of it, events happened in the past are not as valuable as what will happen in the future. There is no doubt that given the certain amount of time spent on a innovation programme, more time spent on studying history simply means less time on creating and experiencing. For example. If Apple company contributes its most of time on learning their footprints rather than devoting in to new thinking and customer experience, Apple may find itself being caught in the stage where not not be able to progress and gain more market value through its less attractive products. In addition to, some principle and custom laid in the past may not be applicable in the modern society. For instance, in the past, woman was not allowed to do the same things as man do, whereas, as the massive democratization in egalitarian, man and woman should be put in the same footing. However, ignoring the influence of history can bring us no benefits, we may not be able to replicate the success from the history, but, at least, we can avoid the same mistakes and tragedies from happening again. For example, what we had seen time and time again was that war-torn countries and people suffered from the pain of dissolution of family and loss properties. Can we resolve the disputes by learning the causes and ramification from history? Yes, we can. Because if people from different nations can learn each other 's history, it would not only allow people to understand the similarities between them rather than worring about the differences, but also reduce the chance of confrontation. In turn, by embracing different cultures, with the benefits of hindsight, should probably have seen many possible fights being vanished. In conclusion, Winston churchill once said: The further backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see. We can do a better job then our ancestor, but only if we learn from them in relation to their success and failure.\n",

      "textContent--->The clear way of donning vocaloid cosplay fancy dress costumes causes you to a personality which signifies your personal style  What is cosplay? Actually, it is a carrier to combine the field costume as well as engage in, so that you can outline cosplay as \"dressing right up as being a persona pertaining to fun\". Several cartoons, online game, sci-fi, and dream conventions delightful costumed people, and yes it can be quite a wide range of enjoyment to wear up as a well liked individuality with an function. Cosplay includes not merely anime plus game-related costuming, but in addition attire as characters from Videos, sci-fi Television for computer series, musicals, as well as original styles. The largest explanation pertaining to cosplay can be \"wearing a dress-up costume inside public\". The way in which I do believe of the usb ports, you could find 2 kinds of cosplay: dress up just like a character, and donning a fancy dress. Outfitting being a individuality suggests that you will be putting on some design of after that possibly be deemed typical outfits. It is deemed an ensemble which you can certainly don in public areas without having having so many bizarre appears to be. Education outfits, Warm Theme attire, venture satisfies, sundresses, plus informal attire most squeeze into the following class. These kinds of heroes usually are the average folks throughout cartoons or video games ( blank ) the varsity individuals, this Pokemon personal trainers, your Naruto Ninjas, the undercover law enforcement, etc. If you do a cosplay like this, you'll get the most effective response through convention-goers if you ever have props befitting for your own individuality. Additionally, should the character has distinct colour or maybe model of head of hair as compared with anyone, be confident to put on your cosplay wig. Dressed in vocaloid cosplay fancy dress outfits can be particular when compared with attire such as a figure. Fancy dress outfits will be attention-getting naturally. That they ordinarily involve large props, out of the ordinary styles of clothes, non-typical tresses styles and colours, armour, wings, and heavy makeup foundation. These kinds of may not be the standard character types throughout cartoons or even game titles -- development of the child players, princesses, marvelous women, gods/goddesses, fairies, angels, demons, pet character types, pets, superheroes, supervillains, imagination government people, and many others. Various video game character types compliment the \"costume\" group as opposed to the \"dressing like a character\" classification ( blank ) any 5-foot blade will probably draw fascination. Here is a normal I prefer utilize to determine which often range of cosplay you happen to be doing: if you happen to can easily dress in a ensemble to KFC in the course of the meal speed therefore you don't get 1 strange seem, next you're not using a dress-up costume. Making cosplay fancy dress costumes on your own is much easier of computer looks, furnished you commence uncomplicated. Acquire numerous research materials for the individuality usually chosen and also require a nearby seem to be on the wardrobe for you to desire to create. The very first measure would be to bust the actual wardrobe on to it's actually portion parts. Many outfits could be build by pieces of standard clothes. Remember to train on a stretchable clothing in which believes relaxing along with enables you to proceed unhampered and promptly into the exhibit. Accessories and also props be capable of turning a great unremarkable cosplay in to the eye-catching at the same time. And also the most crucial aspect of all this is almost always to creating the particular costume outfit as close on the character as manageable.

      "textContent--->Aunt Lu In my Reading& Writting course, I studied Predictable Crises of Adulthood, written by a U. S. writer. She divided life in several stages and concluded character of each stage. And the writting task of this essay is to write a composition of somethone who can fit roughly into the development ladder intorduced by the U. S. writer. The following is my essay. ******* When my mum talks about her former days, a name is often referred to. That is auntie Lu. She is a close friend of my mum. They have known each other since they were at primary school. They attended the same primary school and the same high school, and graduated from the same college. When they were kids, education in China is not compulsory. It was not uncommon for children, especially girls, to drop school. As the eldest child of a poor family, her parents always suggested her stop going to school to help housework. When she was in high school, her mother was ill. Auntie was so desperate that she told my mum that she really had to end her study and help her family this time. My mum was also very sorry. At that time, they two were the only girls who went to high school in their village. And the nearest high school was in another town. Without auntie Lu’s company, my mum had to conquer the long journey alone. But at the beginning of the next semester, my mother was happy to find auntie Lu again. However, they still couldn’t go to school together. Auntie Lu had to do so much housework that she couldn’t attend school on time. Thus, my mum had to go ahead. Although it was very difficult, auntie Lu did finish her study and was admitted by a college. When she graduated from college, she got an assigned job, working as a doctor in the village. There, she met her husband, a school teacher. They got married and had a daughter a year later. Life was simple and comfortable, and auntie Lu enjoyed it very much. But after about 5 years, auntie Lu felt some changes were needed. In the remote village, life was inconvenient, income was low, and career development opportunity is few. What makes the change urgent is the problem about her daughter’s education. She had to move to the village if she wanted to give her daughter a better education. Her family moved to our county when her daughter began primary school. My mum took me visit auntie Lu then. She lived in a rented flat, which was narrow and sparsely furnished. Auntie Lu was very happy to see us and chatted with my mother for a long time. She said although the current life is not easy, she was sure it could be improved in the near future. Auntie Lu was right. Because of her hard working and kind heart, she became a very welcomed doctor in the new hospital. She bought a big house 2 years later and adapted to her new life. One day, a pregnant woman came to her hospital alone. That woman was pale and sorrowful. Auntie Lu asked her what happened. Then she said her boyfriend discarded her and she did not think herself could raise the baby that was to born. Auntie Lu felt very sorry. When she backed home, she told her husband the whole story about the women. She also suggested that they adopt the baby. Her husband thought for a while and drew the conclusion that it would be great to have another child. So untie Lu talked the woman again. The woman agreed because she knew that auntie Lu can give the baby a more stable life. Days later, the woman gave birth to a boy and auntie Lu got a son. From then on, auntie Lu’s attention focused on her work and family. Life again began stable and auntie Lu was contended. In 2004, her daughter leaved home and went to university. Then, auntie Lu had more time for herself. She suddenly realized it was her chance to do something more for herself. Through internet, she found a hospital in Guangzhou was employing doctors. Although she was 41 years old, she would like to have a try. She persuaded her husband and went to Guangzhou alone. At the beginning, there are many difficulties. She was not familiar with the new environment and she missed home badly. But she insisted despite all difficulties. Now, after 5 years, things became much better. She brought a house in Guangzhou last year. But she is still not quite sure whether to settle in Guangzhou or not. She told my mum that depends on her daughter. If her daughter, who is now in the last year of post graduate study, will work in Guangzhou, then her family may move to Guangzhou. If not, she is probably to go back our county years later. But for untie Lu herself, the outside world is not that as attractive to explore as before.\n",

      "textContent--->Be the way you are A recent movie recall my memories of like,eighth grade(the 3rd year in junior middle school)? We were assigned to write an article about dreaming. Then next week on the first period, the teacher was so furious to declare that she found someone's work was definitely the copies from outsiders' public paper. From thus,I confirmed that there is no such absolutely just recognization really happened so much so often. And to cheering up the creativity (of the piece of work which is goooood enough to be identified as a knockoff ), I thought I do earn myself a little more boast : people think and act in their routine, that's why they often hide their motivation and always persuade others NOT TO do sth beyond understanding. As time goes by,I find no matter what the truth is,people only see what they want to see. So, that will be a tough project to make everyone surround you do your interst without hesitation (PS: forgive my abuse of western language if it might be). They might strike you when you give a prospectus, they just say the opposite when the critical time comes,they can do anything abnormal and trust it or not,always accompanied by reasons. Is the way as similar as we conclude ?--if one sets his mind to do sth,sooner or later he can find his path & means . The point is we make mistakes,finding ourselves spending time in proving to others that we're not stupid which, on the contrary do the uselessness. The harder we try the more hopeless we feel. Time flies we all have to move on. We so bond to have because we are born with nothing and deny failure unconscious of the fact that everything begin with a trust. So... again,let's spare the time of acknowledging and do it though hard. Last month the Africa PD wanted to have a guy enrolled for him in response to the \"dissonance\" of the team. Saying this,I never think my english is good,I do not know what is the professional band 8 for,especially when you see so many graduates who was practicing language training from 7 just like us but still don’t know how to extend it. And mostly,I figured all of the world,people communicate without useing word merely,it’s… sort of heart,perhaps. So like other stupid certification which I might wanna to gain through examination in Oct,I never think it’s a must. Even that I do not speak the beautiful accent like 10years ago,even if I can not express myself clearly to win your support any longer,I just keep the right way I am,and I just believe everyone who has his own will be loved by his circle and destiny. I like the people who accept challenge and willing to explore his extrem.

It is reported such solar total eclipse of this time only occurs once during a period of 100 years in its coverage area. Changzhou city where I live just belong to this area. Actually I remember quite clearly I have ever observed the solar eclipse when I was just a primary scholar, so I don’t understand why this eclipse that will occur tomorrow has still been described as “the chance you can meet only once during your lifetime ”on paper and TV  . Maybe the solar eclipse I watched in my childhood was just the partial eclipse . Anyway I think probably tomorrow all the people of Changzhou will be watching the total eclipse, a very fancy astronomic vision , about at 8 o'clock if it does't rain. I have been aware from internet that people must wear standard goggle to watch the total eclipse of Sun or else people's eyes will be harmed. But I don't know where to get the special glasses , maybe I can but watch the eclipse via TV or internet. Have you ever watched the real solar total eclipse? ( I just listend to the weather forecast ,it says it 's going to rain tomorrow morning. It seems the unusual chance will become impossible:(   )\n",

To my suprise I found that there were far fewer people than that of last year when we arrived, may be I thought because various of events were canceled for the big eathquake took place last month. But in the afternoon more and more people were gathered, they seated under the cherry trees, laughing,drinking and eating. I happened to meet my friend, who came to see cherry with family too, so my daughter was very happy because there are lots of kids could play toghter. I think I will come here next year.\n",

I don't know what the bug's name is. I only know that they always appear in the summer nights,circling lights. Wherever there is a bunch of light, they will fly to it. I think their life are really short, several days for them to turning from eggs to bugs, one night for them to seek light. And then, die. Like a flying moth darts into the fire. Just for one night's light. I think they may be satisfied, as they are preparing for and doing the pursue for light. Now, ask yourself, what's your pursue in your life? What's your dream?

But I felt good when I watched movie. How comes, am I sick? movie sick? I watched the \"Sin City\" \"The last Samurai\". I found that the dialogues of \"Sin City\" were too complicated and I had too read the subtitles for many times, and sometimes I could understand it well. Luckly I  got translated subtitles. LOL! Back to the film, it was very cool film, and Jessica Alba was so hot. HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I learned a word from the film \"yeesh\". LOL! It's very funny when the actors and actress said it. \"The last Samurai\", it's good too, but I can't remember too much after I watched it. I seldom watch scary movies except when I was with my friend. But I alway lived alone so I haven't watch it for a long. It is because I often think too much after I watched scary movies. When I was young I couldn't go to tolite after watched it. I think I'm cowarly :(. Lately I just learn something, mainly in theory things,  it is very slowly. I'm hungry! LOL! I haven't had dinner. I will write what I recall later.\n",

      "textContent--->7753_2 Stepping Out on the Way of Application Now it's July and I'm in the US, the issue of application, which I'd always evaded, is manifesting itself in its full form. Frankly speaking, I'm a total beginner about this matter. I had always been aware of the weight of the issue, but never got a starting point. People are always telling me, 'Search the Internet', 'Read books', and so on, but without a specific aim, I couldn't even make the first step. In a telephone call home this Wednesday evening, I asked Mom desperately for some items of information that could direct my searching. Finally she gave some suggestions at random, like the namelist of the professors, and the statistics of Chinese students' admissions, etc. Although I knew that it was little use to get just the names and numbers, but I was expecting to encounter something really valuable on the roadside. I started with the website of MIT. I did find a handful of numbers, but the visit didn't give me any other useful information. I felt discouraged. And I was doubting whether it was futile work to gather data from the official website from scratch. Surely some pioneers should have summarized such information somewhere. And starting from Google, I ended up in Baidu Knows, where a reply to a question on application said, 'Read Ten Talks with Taisha, then we can talk.' I've heard about Taisha before. It was a community that had something to do with the GRE test and the like. I decided to take a glimpse at the book anyway. And I seemed to have found the beacon. By comparing application to the marketing of a product, the book answered lots of questions that had hung uncertain in my head for months, or even years. Rather than applying for schools, I understood, we are applying for professors. So the most important thing is to know about and get familiar with the professors. There'll certainly be a lot of interaction; I'll have to pluck up my courage and take the initiative. Having read two talks of the ten, I felt that I was learning a brand new theory, and had an impulse to share it with somebody. But when I raised my head from the computer screen, I realized that the people around me, more or less, all knew more about application than I did. Even though they didn't necessarily know about the theory of marketing, they had already absorbed quite some information about the schools. Actually I was not a pioneer exploring a virgin forest, but just catching up with everyone else. I felt urged to go on. The third talk was about self-positioning. This is actually an essential issue that has always kept bothering me. Judging from what I've done, I indeed cannot be more ordinary; I do have a few achievements that could make others admire, but they are beyond the field of electronic engineering and therefore do not contribute to the possibility of my getting favored by the professors. But one night last month, I had discovered with the help of Mom that I could draw confidence from my down-to-earth attitude. However, I have to decide soon on which of these two mentalities I should base my application. It's gonna be a cruel spiritual battle. But anyway, I'm on my way.\n",

      "textContent--->a psychological fator  \tAs we all know , the housing price has remained  at a high level for several years and it seems difficult to go down . Hence , many people become increasingly worried  that they couldn't afford to buy a house in the near future. Under the pressure , more and more people manage to buy a house as soon as possible these days and make a larger demand for house market . As a result,  it tends to pose scare-buying which may stimulate the housing price to go on soaring in return. \tIn fact, i have heard something real from my uncle...... \tHe ever said that because of worrying his son cannot afford to buy a new house which may be sold at a sky high price in the future, he preferred to buy one for his son first in spite of resorting to borrowing money and even maintain a loan . Of course, the rest money that should be paid for the new house will be in the charge of his son in the future. \tYou see , my uncle just one example , and i think in the society there can  be  more parents take the same action as my uncle out of anxiety for the high housing price in the future. Such a psychological factor causing such behavior  can be perceived as considerate for the next generation, but it can also contribute to raising the housing price nowadays. actually, this article is my  English homework. It's part of an English presentation which topic is\" What are the causes for the sky-rocketing housing prices in the big cities? \"of our group.

      "textContent--->是否赞同把大公司和工厂搬去rural area Due to traffic congestion and housing problem, there is a trend that big companies and factories tend to move to rural area. I personally agree with the statement that moving big companies and factories serve practical and useful propose. Firstly, factories emit/produce exhaust gas, which pollutes the city air and damages people health. When the factories have been moved, the air quality in urban area can be improved. Secondly, relocation of companies will provide more employment opportunities to the rural area and it can make contribution to eliminate poverty. Furthermore, since the price of land in city center has been increasingly higher, with companies moved to countryside, the land can be saved for other purposes such as building hospitals or constructing a modern residential complex. However, moving big companies is not with its own downside. The employees may be reluctant to go to work at a place where is far from their house. The more disturbing fact is that some people may find themselves have difficulties in adjusting themselves to the new working conditions which leads to lower the productivity. Furthermore, the undeveloped infrastructure may fail to meet the demand of the modern production. In my conclusion, moving big companies and factories certainly bring enormous benefits, while the individual’s choices should be respected.\n",

She wanted me to keep a quirt like a girl, even if it is only few minutes. I do not think so, because I thought boy is different from girl. When I studied in primary school, my teacher always said that Shay was a naughty and crazy student which she had never met. After graduating from primary school, I studied in high school where my mother taught math. In the high school, I found I was extremely interesting in math and physical. From that moment, I vowed I would be an engineer. Up still now, I have been attempting to achieve my dream. On the other hand, I like military so much. Extreme sports are all my another hobby.

Then I was given a new memory. And I insist it is true. Cause it had ever happened in my mind. In another word, it exist in my mind. But it is virtual. Oh, what am I thinking...??

I have asked YY earlier see if she has anything  she want me to talk to teacher. She just complained the math is too simple to her. I know she have learned lot of math during the summer vacation when she was in Beijing with my parents. My mom was a middle school math teacher. She liked to teach YY math and she was happy to learn it. Before I went to see teacher I was thinking maybe they could put her in the higher grade’s math class, so she will have more challenges. YY is in grade 2 now and this was the first time I met her teacher. Ms. L. is a short Asian woman, probably on her 50s. She showed me YY’s journal, math practice & English notebook from school. After one month school, Ms. L thinks YY is doing pretty well in the school in different areas which is good to hear. I brought up YY’s math frustration. Ms. L explained to me that it’s just very beginning of the semester and the plan is starting from easy level. Instead of simply asking kids to calculate 6 plus 8 she is  teaching kids to use the math on solving the questions which are prescribed in wording. Kids have to read the questions carefully, come with an equitation and calculate the results. Ms. L has noticed a few kids are frustrated and claimed it’s too simple for them. She tried to explain to them that this stage is focusing on the logical thoughts and they will get into more complicated math later. I got her idea but still asked her if it’s necessary to put YY in the higher grade’s math class. Ms. L’s thinks following her pace for now might be a good idea for YY to shaped their mind to understand the math is a tool instead of just abstract addition & subtraction. I think she is probably right. Since YY is not a native English speaker I was wondering if she needs ESL support which she had in kindergarten. Ms. L said YY doesn’t need extra ESL support anymore and her English is fine. She showed me YY’s daily journal and told me YY is getting better on writing, but YY needs to learn how to write more complicated sentences. YY likes reading and I hope she will pick it up soon.\n",

      "textContent--->Parents are the best teachers?? During our life time, we could have met various kinds of teacher. These teachers do not only including teachers in campus. Parents, grandparents, friends, even strangers could benefit us and be our teacher. Therefore, I personally disagree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. My point of view could list as follows. Firstly, the statement is way to extreme, parents might somehow influence children a lot, teach them all kinds of things. However, not all parents are good teacher. For instance, not all parents are highly educated, thus they might not have the ability to teach everything that their children need, even though they love their children deeply, there still are something they can do. What’s more, a few parents might not well behavior themselves, which could have bad effect on their children. Secondly, the children was born with a nature—the authority of teachers (school teacher). Teachers’ education sometimes much more efficient then parents. When comes to learning something professional, school teachers have a big influence on children, they will behavior themselves, finish the task on time and with good quality. Further more, when children need to further their education, they need professional teacher to guide them. That is beyond parents’ capability. Thirdly, I think it is probably much more appropriate to say that parents are good teachers, well, most of them. Parents are the most important persons to children, every parent want to offer their children everything they can. No one could replace their spot. Parents teach children how to speak, walk and so many things with great patient. Keep them out of danger. Parents also teach their children the virtuous qualities of human behavior. To sum up, there is no question that parents plays an important role in children’s life, and no such love could beyond parent’s love to their children. Children could have met many teachers that could influence and teach them, parents just a part of them. Parents might be the first teacher of children, by no means the best.\n",

She said \"no possibility\", which broke my heart desperately. But I still love her so much. I don't know what to do now, so I keep sending more messages without any reply. I know one day I will change her and get into her heart, and what's I am wondering is that how soon it can be ================================= minicat, I am unlucky that I didn't know it earlier. The fact is I am already deeply in love, and the worst thing is that I can change it. mdspencer ,all you suggestions are full of wisdom. I am just afraid that if I don't send the messages, she will soon forget about me. She don't want to talk to me in class now.( by the way, we are classmate in college.) I know I am stupid to have declared it so early without enough communication with her. I hate myself. virtually, I don't know how to change her attitude towards me. What I am doing is only encourage myself that with constituent effort, there can be something for harvest.. ============================ I know I was to eager to speak out those stupid words, and I have reflected my faults for times. But it's not the time for me to regret and denounce myself. It's definitely the truth that she is to ideal in my heart for the lack of communication between us. I am thinking what's the best for me to do next, which may change some of the current situation and both of us more understandable and transmitable to the other one. Of course I am trying to manage my own problem, thus those days I spent most of  my time on study instead of thinking of her. Maybe if I am more knowledgeable and smart, she can feel the brighter perspective of my life and think higher of me. ---------------------------- I am afraid that she is not capable of doing the blocking stuff because of the lack of technical knowledge. But certainly she can ignore most of them, which I hate and worry about most. So I demand myself to send less and so that the messages can be more effective. I have lots of good friends in my class and they help me. Even the girls in her dormitory bedroom offered their help. But in fear of his losing of feeling of security, I don't depend on them a lot.

      "textContent--->[Español] La corrida La corrida es un espectáculo exclusivamente español. Se celebra desde tiempos antiguos y durante su historia ha cambiado bastante. La línea principal de esta competición es una lidia entre el toro y el torero que tenía un sentido simbólico de la lucha entre el hombre y la muerte.  Las corridas de toros crean controversia en muchos países del mundo aunque en España. Antitaurinos luchan contra corridas creyéndolas crueles y agresivas. Debido a protestas antitaurinos Barcelona y la región de Cataluña declararon la prohibición de corridas. En cambio, la gente taurina aprecia corridas y sabe disfrutarlo.  El ordén de acontecimientos durante la corrida es como así. En los principios de la corrida el toro y el torero se encuentran cara a cara. Después vienen los picadores a caballos. Ellos están bien protegidos y su misión es herir ligeramente al toro para que esté mas débil y el torero pueda luchar con él.  Después aparecen los banderilleros quienes fatigan al toro clavando las banderillas. Luego empieza la faena de la suerte de muleta y posteriormente el matador le da muerte al toro con el estoque.  El responsable por todo lo que sucede en la Plaza de toros es el Presidente de la corrida. Él decide cambiar los toros si son flacos, procura que los órdenes se acaten y otorga premios como orejas o el rabo del toro matado.  Para los quienes no son profesionales hay capeas. Son lidias de novillos para los aficionados que se puede encontrar en las bodas o fiestas privadas. \n",

      "textContent--->... People like adventures. They know that some of them are risky, but that is what attracts people most. In anticipation of a good time, sometimes we forget to think about notifying  somebody where we are going,  or taking a health insurance with us, or renewing it. We like to see only positive pictures of our  adventurous trip in our mind. Unfortunately,  in reality  sometimes problems occur regardless of our desire. A couple of years ago,  my friend  Lona was invited to go skiing in Big Bear. Since she was on vacation from work and was actively thinking about a place to take a rest in, and nothing  was coming to her mind, she was more than happy to accept the invitation. Upon arrival at Big Bear, the weather  was beautiful. It was sunny and cool with a refreshing slight wind, only thirty seven degrees all day. It looked like the perfect day for skiing. At first, her friend and she checked into their hotel. Then they went straight  to the mountain slope to attempt to ski down the mountain. They spent an hour together having lots of fun skiing  until Lona’s friend got exhausted and was ready to go to the hotel to get some rest. On the other hand,  Lona  was still full of energy to continue her  attempts to conquer the mountains. She decided to stay there a little bit longer. At some point, she realized how many handsome men there were. Catching some looks at herself, she started smiling archly  in return. She was so flattered by the attention from the men that she stopped looking ahead. Suddenly, she  found herself flying down the mountain uncontrollably. She  lost her balance, fell, and crashed into a small pine tree. Soon, some guy  approached her to ask if she was okay, but she was not. As it turned out later, she had broken her spine. Someone called 911 and after some period of time people in white scrubs were there to help her. The damage of her spine was very serious. She needed a surgery. The cost of it was way more than she expected it to be: fourteen thousand American dollars. The problem was that she forgot to renew  her health insurance and now she had to pay the full price. She did not have that amount of money on her at that moment. What made the situation even worse that she had left her cell phone in her hotel room. It was 11 pm  and Lona’s friend started to worry about her. When  the clock hit twelve,  her friend took action and  called the local hospitals to find out if Lona was there. She spent hours calling and finally, one of the hospitals confirmed that lona was there with broken spine. Luckily, her friend let her borrow that amount of money and she got a surgery. It could have been less expensive if Lona had  renewed her insurance plan. Her friend could have found her much more quickly if she had taken her cell phone with her. Lona learned the lesson. Now she is more responsible when it comes to traveling, and you? \t\n",

Children experience incredibly strong feelings every single moment, most adults don’t experience anything like that during all their lives.

      "textContent--->The Moneychangers by Arthur Hailey I'm reading The Moneychangers by Arthur Hailey. This book may seem dated in terms of banking technologies, but ethic and social problems discussed in this book are still hot, and they become even hotter since global recession is not overcome yet. One of the topics discussed passionately in the book is credit cards. Credit cards are omnipresent in the Western world, but they are far from being popular in Russia still. When my husband and I moved to Canada, we learned that one's credit history is a synonym of one's reputation. They want you to build up your credit history as soon as possible. You may live in your own and need no loans from bank, but you should have a credit card and make purchases with it, because auto dealers, land lords, insurance agents and whole lot of other people and institutions want to check your credit history before they start dealing with you. Can you imagine that in 1975 people thought about ethic aspects of credit cards? Here is the quote:  “... thousands of people who shouldn't are piling up long-term debts by using credit cards. Often it's to buy trivia — drugstore items, music records, bits of hardware, books, meal, other minor things; and they do it partly because of unawareness, partly because small amounts of credit are ridiculously easy   to obtain. And those small amounts, which ought to be paid by cash,add up to crippling debts, burdening imprudent people  for years ahead.”  The major difference between 1975 and 2010 is that today, everybody is taking credit cards for granted and refuses to think why the interest rate for a regular loan is a single digit number, while interest rates for credit cards are about 20%. “Thousands of Canadians are blind to see their personal bankruptcy coming,” an advertising in the Toronto subway said. This is so true, also the fact is that the society that used to live in debts, is blind to see the direct connection between the system that force you to have a credit card and the impressive amount of personal bankruptcy cases. Dialogues about the economic situation of the United States sound like being taken from today's newspapers. Here is another quote:  “There’s also more debt that can ever be repaid; debt that’s expanding like a monstrous bubble. American governments have spent billions wildly, borrowed insanely, piled up debits beyond believing, then used the printing press to create more paper money and inflation. … When will people relearn the lesson that there isn’t any easy debt? i tell you? as a nation and as individuals, Americans have lost what they once had — financial sanity.”  Arthur Hailey depicted this 35 years ago. What I've seen in the North America this Summer was tired people who are afraid to lose their work not because they love it, but because they have to pay their bills. You need a place to live — no problem, a bank will give you a mortgage. You want a new car — no problem, you may get leasing or financing. You may get everything right here and now, but because of the interest rates, you'll pay twice and thrice for all this. The whole system works in this way that you have no time and no will to stop and think about what's going on and how it comes so that you are in debts and will pay quite a big share of your earnings to the bank during the rest of your life.\n",

Every time one guy sells, another one buys, and they both think they're smart\" ) Today I have some free time in the office and I want to write something else about my life. Besides my main work I have another source of income. I invest in stocks. I don't have a lot, but it's interesting and I do have a economic education after all. Of course I'm not a professional, so... it's like a hobby. Also it is very interesting to watch how the world's news (whatever- good or bad, political, economic, social etc.) affects the market instantly! As you know Russia has a very perspective stock market, especially talking about natural resource companies. I began this business over one and a half years ago, when the stock markets all over the world dropped because of the economics’ crisis in the world. And the prices were low - so the moment was perfect for entry. And now a trend is growing and we have positive thoughts and hopes. But in my opinion, if there is no real strong economy, if factories don’t produce goods and people don't buy goods... Then there is no way for the economy to grow. I want to say that the stock market doesn't reflect the real situation in the economy of the country. Quite the contrary- instead of buying shares, people could actually invest their money in real production. But now it's like money from the air, and it's strange in modern conditions. So, maybe someday the stock market will be only history?  )))\n",
      "textContent--->I’m confused This December I’ve passed a B1-level exam in German at the Goethe Institute. My parents were really proud of me, but they also immediately wondered, if there were such an exam in English as well. “Why haven’t you taken a similar Exam in English? You’ve been learning it all your life so that you are sure to pass the CAE”  In fact, I’ve contemplated that myself, but having looked through the sample papers I realized that I still have a long way to go. Not that I knew the language badly, but some tasks like Open Cloze or Writing tasks seem really challenging. The next exam is held in March 2011 which means that I don’t have that much time to get prepared. But they won’t stop insisting on my filling in the registration form. I have admitted to my parents that I’m simply afraid of failing the exam or(which is just a little less humiliating) getting a low grade. Each time I try to drop that topic. The answer always is: “At least it’ll be a valuable experience for you, you’ll be able to try again” If only the really thought that way. I know, what they think is: “Of course you’ll pass, you just have cold feet, we believe in you”. Now it seems that I’m really taking that exam this spring. This is bad news for me taking into consideration that I was going to try B2 level in German. Now I’m it for a hard time!\n",

      "textContent--->Dostoyevsky  Fyodor Dostoyevsky is one of the most famous and important Russian writers and thinkers. In addition, he’s one of my favorite writers. He was born on the 30th of October (or on the 11th of November in Julian calendar) in 1821 in Moscow. By the way, there’s a supposition that his father was Belorussian. He (I mean his father) was educated in 1828 and was a physician in a Moscow clinic. In 1831-2832 he bought a little estate and was known for cruel treatment of peasants. The mother came of a merchant stock. Fyodor was the second from seven children in the family. When Dostoyevsky was 15 his mother died of consumption; and the father sent the eldest brothers Fyodor and Mikhail (who became a writer afterwards either) to a boarding school in St. Petersburg. The year 1837 was a very important date for Dostoyevsky. In this year his mother died, it was also the year of Pushkin’s death (Pushkin is the most famous Russian poet) whose works had used to carry away Fyodor and his brother since they were children. In that year Fyodor also moved to Petersburg and entered the Military Engineering-Technical University. In 1839 he received the news that his father was killed by serfs. Fyodor took part in work of еру Belinsky’s circle. It was one year before transferring to the reserve when Fyodor translated a book by Balzac. Iе was published in the same year. In a year the 1st book written by Dostoyevsky called “Poor Folk” was published. He becomes famous at once. Belinsky appreciated the work very highly. However, the next work “The Double” had lack of understanding. Soon after “Poor Folk” was published the writer was arrested for a participation in a revolution group. Although he denied the imputations, court declared him as one of the most important criminals. To be continued...:)\n",

Corect my Russian English!  ^-^ It is known that Bruce Lee could pierce a hole in the can of Coke ( that time those cans were several times  firmer),  and 24 frames  per second camcorder couldn`t reflect all the movements of his hands-0,05 of a second for a DELIEVERING A BLOW. But it is not only for his talent   for martial arts but he could incarnate on the screen the image of the fighter, master, who devoted his life to kung-fu. For millions of people he became a model, because of him many people on the West started practicing kung-fu. Bruce Lee was born the 27th November, 1940, in San-Francisco, the USA, during his parent`s guest performances: his father was a comic actor. According to Chinese moon calendar he was born in the year of Dragon, and the time from 6 to 8 a.m. is the Hours of Dragon. He was the most restless in his family; he has wild, unbridled, amazingly alert character, which was the reason of his incredible misbehavior. His mother called him Mo Xi Tong (never staying along in one place). The only one thing which made him quiet was reading books. His father considering that quiet taiji would pacify savage temper of his son made him practicing it. But it didn`t work. He wasn`t fond of science, didn`t have remarkable success in studying and bore a great aversion to Maths  ,  this fact in  aggregate with his “asking  for trouble” character became the reason forced him to switch several schools. “The spirit of a fighter” showed itself in his early years, he was looking the opportunity to fight, and he wanted to assert himself. His authority among boys was unquestionable. But one day he met a foeman worthy of his steel, who was a very skinny 13-year boy. Bruce was self-assured but suffered a defeat.\n",

      "textContent--->Value of music Hope you will enjoy the reading, and I will enjoy the corrections ^_~ _________ From simple folksongs to a complex symphony orchestra, music has been created by every known society. However, music does not seem to help us to live longer or pass our genes more efficiently. Neither is it a primary mean of communication, unlike language. Psychologists might say that this form of art speaks to the heart. The evidence of that music corresponds to certain emotions and even induces the new ones is startlingly direct. Therefore, music accompany every pivotal occasion in our lives, whether it is joyful like wedding or sad such as a funeral. It taps into the mind and forces into the trance or ecstasy otherwise. In such a way it helps to endure the pain from self-torture during the bloody religious feasts, which are practiced in Thailand Vegetarian Festival, for example. Today, however, music tends to internationalize and becomes similar in a number of countries that I consider an inexcusable waste. Music industry is oriented to average consumer and aim to sell as many compositions and recordings as possible, destroying the essence of music itself. The result of that is soulless, down-home background tune. On contrary, the traditional music has a millennial history, which includes the history of every particular nation and folk wisdom. Furthermore, the meaningful lyrics it has teach us the overall values of life. In conclusion, the role of music is undeniably huge and it goes without saying that the value of national music is a head taller than music of ‘public use’.\n",

So, here I go! I have been to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, two years ago. I was travelling by coach with the group of tourists and guide and I need to admit that this sort of travelling - crowded bus, constant bustle and hurry is not what I really like... But anyway, somehow I managed to enjoy my little adventure in toto. The first thing we saw was Old Town, the oldest of the towns of Prague gained the privileges of a town in the 13th century. And of course our group came to see the medieval Astronomical Clock or Prague Orloj. The Astronomical Dial shows the medieval perception of the Universe: the Earth is the centre, the Sun rotates around it. Clock shows three different times: the Italian Time, the Central European Time and the Babylonian Time. Also the length of an hour differs according to the season. Every hour, then the clock is striking, some wooden sculptures begin to move and figures of apostles appear in the little windows, and after that the golden cockerel screeches in a funny voice (as I remember). Also they have French formal gardens, beautiful in theirs artificiality.(The guide headed us to the park to take a rest.) I saw an albino peafowl there :) The bird was absolutely gorgeous and it displayed nothing but boredom while we were trying to take some pictures. Eventually I separated from my noisy group and ran away to see Zoo and romantic Troja chateau. The most remarkable things about Troja chateau are the gardens - huge, bushes cut perfectly in geometrical shapes,  fountains with crystal-clear water, and the garden staircase with statues representing heroes of Greek mythology. It was already evening then I entered Troja chateau and for my great delight the building was absolutely empty! I was walking on a ground floor, though. I after a few minutes I came across the large door with plate lettered 'Tartarus',  I tried it and it fitted! I was stunned. There was sculptures of two Ancient Greek heroes thrown into the Tartarus - the Hell, the figures were massive, made of stone and the bright sunlight came from above.\n",
      "textContent--->USSR part 1 Some facts about the USSR falling apart. Live in the USSR was paradise. To some extent, of course. I was a child back than, so maybe I couldn't get the whole picture, but from what I remember it was fantastic compared to what I had to experience later after the fall of the empire. I lived in a beautiful town called Sukhum in Georgia, USSR. It was a beautiful town on the Black sea. Everybody would love to live there. Everyday I went to school and had lots of fun after. My father worked in a secret research facility in a plasma something laboratory. I don't remember the name of the thing. He was the leading engineer there. My mother was a secretary to some director or sheaf of something in the same facility. We lived a 20-minutes-walk way from the school and about the same distance from the facility. Every winter we went on a small 2 week vacation in a small town in the Mountains in Georgia, in about 7 hours on the train and then 2 hours on the bus from Sukhum, for we lived in a place where snow was a real rarity. In the summer many relatives and friends came to stay at our place. In those times, every family had its own apartment or a room in an dormitory. In big cities there were lots of dormitories, but where I lived there weren't so many and many people lived in houses. You could buy a house, but you couldn't buy an apartment. An average house cost about two times an average car, and to buy a car an average Russian had to save money for several years like 8 or 10 years for you couldn't buy in credit for there were no credits in the USSR. There also were those who didn't have to wait for so long. They could buy a house or a car in no time with the help of their family. People usually got their apartments for free, but before getting one you usually had to wait in line for about 10 years or so. Of course, people paid for electricity,water, central heating and some very low rent. When you got your flat you had to register there, and the apartment became the place of your permanent residence. You couldn't easily change your place of residence, and you had to exchange your apartment with someone else for it was impossible to buy or sell apartments in the USSR. Exchanging apartments was a real trouble for those who wanted to move. Though, it worked well. You couldn't just start wanting to move to another town and the next day rent a flat there, because there were a bunch of laws against it. You had to register in the new town etc. This registration process was a real pain. Sometimes, you had to wait in the line for hours etc, and the system was quite slow and annoying. Another thing that every body hated was the deficit. It's when you go to a shop and there is almost nothing you can buy. Of course you can buy, but you need a special coupon. So there were coupons for almost everything like sugar, bikes, sausages etc. Even to buy a tea pot you needed a coupon. You work more you get more coupons. Of course, there were things you could buy without a coupon, but they were usually sold-out very quickly. I'm sorry for the long text. If you could correct even some sentences, I'd be very glad. Thank you. (to be continued)\n",

Police came to the mansion and said that there was a body of a man lying dead on the path that led through the jungle to Kabulong. The author realized that it was Bronson and he broke the news to Mrs. Bronson about what had happened. When the narrator, doctor and sergeant arrived to the body, they saw some footprints that showed them – the Bronson and the murderer were acquaintance. Whoever had murdered Bronson hadn't done it for money. Meanwhile Cartwright took up the management of Bronson's estate and the murderer wasn’t found. But it’s almost obvious. But it’s quite obvious, doesn't it? The Ant and the Grasshopper by W. S. Maugham The author met his acquaintance, George Ramsay. That man was looking very sad and gloomy and the narrator understood at once that George’s brother played dirty tricks again, as he knew him quite well. The Ramsays were respectable people and everybody thought Tom (the brother) would make a great career and in the very beginning he started his life decently enough: he married, went into business and had two children. But one day he announced that he’d had enough and starting from that moment he began to enjoy the life: dropped his job out and left his wife. No one could refuse to borrow him money, since he was so charming and lively. Very often he turned to George who gave him once or twice considerable sums to start his own business, but every time he spent that money for nothing. Tom even begun to blackmail George when he rejected to “borrow” him another sum and George had to pay again. Tom was young and happy at his 46 while poor George grew old and looked as he was 60 in spite of the one year difference between them. But George waited till Tom would be 50 and then, George thought, he wouldn’t find life so easy. But eventually Tom married old rich woman who died in a couple of weeks after it and left him a tremendous fortune. In my opinion this story demonstrates the simple fact that people shouldn’t interfere into each other’s lives or teach them lessons but live their own one decently. The happy man by W. S. Maugham One day the author was asked to give a man advice. It was a total stranger who read the book about Spain the narrator wrote. The man, Stephens, was a medical officer and he was woebegone because of his life where, as he thought, he didn’t make anything useful. It was a little man, thickset and stout, of thirty perhaps, with a round face and twinkle in his eyes. So he asked if it would better to move to Spain or stay where he lived. He completely deferred to the author since he knew about that country more than anybody else among Stephens acquaintance. So the author response was that if he wanted to earn a good living so he should stay and if it was just enough to keep his body and soul together whatever his livelihood would – he should go to Spain. The man went away and the author forgot about him very soon. Years after he came to a small village, Seville, that in Spain having a trifling indisposition for that time. Found an English doctor he recognized his old acquaintance, Stephens. He grew bald and fat but there was a smile on his face. The author found out that Stephen got divorced with his previous wife and now lived with an attractive Spanish woman. He didn’t earn any money but finally found his own happiness in the backwoods.\n",

      "textContent--->My learning experience The desire to learn is perhaps the most extraordinary necessity of a human. Moreover, the more one learns the easier he finds it to acquire good learning skills. And the more he practises his learning style the quicker he learns. Personally I have been learning English since early childhood. In those days all I wanted was just to know a few words so that to say just a few sentences in class. It was only in high school that I first felt the joy of learning a foreign languange. My first authentic resources were 'Three Men in a Boat', 'The Godfather', 'Great Gatsby', 'How to Steal a Million', ''Snow White and Seven Dwarfs'. It seemed like a miracle to be able to understand and speak a foreign language. Many years have passed since that time. I'm still learning English. Now that I am a grownup and know what my learning style actually is, I can learn a great deal more at a time. Having been motivated in high school I think I can hardly stop learning now as I believe there is no end mastering English. Thanks for yout help to improve this passage.\n",

      "textContent--->Deliberation upon nuclear disarmament(composition). Part 1. It’s quite obvious that fear is the reason why some countries seek nuclear status. How can we condemn Iran for its aggressive rhetoric taking into account the US’s open deliberation upon the possible military attack on the country? At the same time, Israel is widely considered to possess up to 200 nuclear charges. What state would put up with a situation when his open adversary can wipe it off the face of the earth? And the most unfair side to it is that little global attention is now drawn to this fact. The only achievable solution to the Isreali-iranian conflict seems to be mutual nuclear disarmament. A new Middle East treaty should ensure that neither Iran nor Israel has nuclear weapons or enrichment facilities, their entire nuclear infrastructure should be under IAEI safeguards, Israel is to finally join the NPT. Of course both Israel and the US are unlikely to welcome such a step, but his seems the only compromise left. And if Iran’s determination to become a nuclear power results in the US‘s starting an attack on the country it will undermine peace and security of the whole world. Similarly Iran’s acquisition of nuclear status will give up for lost the whole period of successful force of the NPT.\n",

      "textContent--->Essay. Older parents The topic was about reasons why people have children older, why is this happening and what are the possible consequences of that for the family and the society. There has been a rapid decline in early childbearing recently. Nowadays more women decide to postpone the pregnancy until the age of 35 and above. There is a variety of reasons to do so. First of all, to be competitive in labour market women and men put career establishment as their first goal. Also they may consider giving birth a particularly demanding commitment, and struggle to raise their financial security. Young people in their 20s and early 30s might be afraid of possible lack of psychological matureness. Obviously, the middle-aged people have wide life experience, sense of responsibility and are more reliable. Younger people may deem themselves not prepared for parenthood. Such a hesitation may effect severely on particular family and society in whole. The age difference between child and parent may be very significant, and cause constant conflicts, especially during the puberty age. Also there is a high possibility that elderly parents will leave their offspring orphans early. What is more, the children of older fathers are expected to have lower IQ results, and Down's Syndrome are more common among these children. Societal consequences may be especially harsh in developing countries. Because of inadequate pension provisions children play a crucial role in parents supporting, either financially or practically. The lack of prospective tax payers may markedly effect the economy of developed countries. In summary, the societal need to have children latter in life and biological need to have them early may effect on their physical and mental health, as well as have a negative impact on society’s wellbeing.\n",

I'm sure I shan't be able to. I will by too far off to trouble myself  about you: you must manage the best why you can - but I must be kind to them\", thought Alice,\"or they won't to go the way I want to go! Let me think: I'll buy them a new pair of boots every Christmas!\" And she went on planning how she would manage it. \"They must go by the carrier. And how funny it'll seem to sent a presents to one's own feet. And how odd the directions will look! Oh dear, that nonsense I'm talking!\" Then suddenly her head struck against the roof of the hall, so terribly tall she became. And she took the little golden key at once and hurried off to the little door. Poor Alice! It was the only thing she could do, is to lay down and look trough the little door with one eye. The things were worst then ever, so Alice sat down and began to cry again. \"You ought be ashamed of yourself,\", she said loudly,\"a big girl like you (she might well say that), to go on crying! You must leave off this minute, I tell you!\" But she went all the same, shedding gallons of tears till there was a large pool around her. After a time she heard a pattering of feet and dried her eyes hastily to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit, splendidly dressed, with a pair of kid-gloves in one hand and the big fan in the over, trotting along in a great hurry. He was muttering to himself, as he came \"Oh the Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage, if I've kept her waiting!\" Alice was so desperate, that she was ready to ask help of anyone: so, then the White Rabbit came nearer to her, she began in a low, timid voice \"If you please, Sir -\" but the Rabbit started violently, dropped the gloves and fan, and scurried away as fast as he could. __________ Vuala!

Usually love includes: gentle, care, sex, attraction and a little bit similar thoughts. And we had everything different ... We arranged debates on all the topics we've always proved our innocence, we always saved only our opinion, we have never come to an agreement. We forget our quarrels in 10 minutes.

Firstly, we've chosen the highest ice-hill. By the time we'd reached the top, we were on our last legs. The time fun began! I sledded the first. Screaming and squealing on the corners I didn't notice how boy and girl appeared straight in front of me. I shouted that they moved aside but they ignored me! I tried to  halt pressing the brake - the sleigh didn't stop. Then I tried to slow down with my feet - it worked! I could breath freely - nobody didn't suffer. Soon parents with their children and skiers arrived. One of the skiers came with his dog. He was very nice). When his owner was rolling down he was running for him. His long ears flapped when he was running and the snow flew out from his paws. But it was getting harder and harder to sled among crowd of people. That's why we went to another ice-hill. Natasha (this is the name of my sister) got into the sleigh and I carried her. From this ice-hill we went down together. I sat behind my sister. And I can't remember the last time when I laughed so laudly. I couldn't see many things because of Natasha's head and it always seemed that we'd run into the tree. Of course, we wouldn't. We went home when my sister said that she was tired. I was surprised because I sledded more often than she and I carried her in the forest. Although she said she would be glad to repeat it. I'm placet! In advance thanks for corrections.\n",

Of course it's a great opportunity to improve my writing skills and help me with my English. Of bloody course. But what would help me with my total absence of talent? I suppose, it must be some kind of an inherent thing, you know. I can't remember anyone in my family smart enough to write books or... play violin and shake hands with Beethoven or Clode Debussy... Just Common people without anything out of the ordinary. To be honest, I hate this \"ordinarity\" if that is the word. To be like everyone else is equal to be  Nobody or smth. But trying to become special makes one instantly such a fool which is equal to \"common\" and ,as a result, equal to Nobody. There are phrases . \"Nothing in particular\" ,\"Nothing special\". What if we replace nothing with nobody? Certainly nothing would happen to you if you do so. Don't even worry about that. The thing is that I have to write smth, even utter nonsense. So here I go. I mean , what actually is \"to be special\"? Not to be like anyone else? But how can I know for sure what people are, those ones whom I'm bumping into in the streets, swearing fiercely and wishing violently to see their tombs? How can I measure their \"specialness\" or \"nonspecialness\"??? Of course one would say \"Everyone is special in their own way. What the hell are you talking about, poor chap?? It's 12 pm and you'd better go to sleep until something bad happens\" By something bad I actually mean every bloody thing that can happen to you at 12 o'clock at night. Vomiting, diarrhea, intrunsion of UFO, or fits of sexual neurosis... Whatever. \"I wish I was special... You're so fucking special... But I'm a creep... I'm a weirdo...\" Radiohead, eh? Well may be weirdoes are the only ones who remain special in their own special way? \"Nobody in their right mind would ever eat wasps plucking them out of their shoes (whose shoes - no idea) . But I'm doing this. 'Cause I'm a weirdo and I don't care. And even If I did I would still remain a weirdo\" And blablabla. Gorgeous post.

Here we go: _____________ Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Ksenya Troitskaya and I am writing to you in response to the advertisement for the employment section of Sunwell Entertainment official website. I enclose my English and Russian résumés for your consideration. I became interested in the Player Coordinator work since I’ve started playing MMORPG and especially ClicheQuest. I had a chance to compare player support standards provided by different game companies (is it ok to call them \"Game Companies\"?) and I’ve always enjoyed high-quality service from Sunwell team. My interest grew stronger as your company has started launching Russian servers and hiring Russian-speaking employees. (is it ok? They started hiring together with preparations to launch, not if they've launched them first and then started hiring)  During my career I have had several diverse jobs, all of them required to work in a team and to deal directly with public.(Doesn't it sound stupid or too, I don't know,  cumbersome?)I found my short-time but intensive work at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in teaching me the importance of ascertaining a variety of customers' needs and providing clear and accurate information in response to those needs. Being a part of Staff Empire recruitment agency has taught me the ability to work in a constant tensioned mode (is this \"mode\" ok? it was crazy time, always under pressure) and still being always available and helpful to (to? for?) both customers and candidates. Although I don’t have any MMORPG working experience, some of my jobs required me to deal with Internet communities using appropriate tools including forums, blogs and some others. Also, as a hobby I managed (as a moderator, how to say this? Moderated? Not sure) some game community forums. I would be grateful if you could consider me suitable for joining excellent   Sunwell team and offer a position of Player Coordinator at any location, France of Ireland. (isn't this too rude? \"Please hire me\") I would be available for abroad travels from the beginning of June (here I mean that my international passport will be ready by that time only, but maybe it's not necessary?), and I am available for interview at any time. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, Ksenya Troitskaya ____ Is it hopeless? >_< UPD: changed names to some unreal.\n",

Some British earl who lived in the end of XXVIII century was very famous of his game of chance liking. He could play cards for several days without stop. In order not to divert his attention out of the game, he ordered to bring him the bread flavored with something, a butter, for instance. The name of earl was Sandwich. When Dmitriy Shostakovich was at a party hosted by British Queen, there was served up a tea with lemon. After a composer had a tea, he took out a lemon from the cup with the spoon and ate it. The court was shocked, but not Queen. She imperturbably took her lemon from the cup and ate too. The incident became a precedent. Since that an etiquette allows to eat a lemon taken from the tea. Japanese scientists invented an invisible coat. It is made of materials, which reflects the subjects on the background. The camera transmits the video signal to the front surface of the coat. Due to this, a man fades in the landscape.(Hmm. Hmmm. Hmmm. If that so, when it will be available in the shops? And what will be approximate price for one unit?)\n",

But I'm glad that my summer was such stupid and may be boring, It doesn't matter. I understood that I actually had a pretty good time. That's all.\n",
      "textContent--->One vivid trip Last winter I went to mountains with my friends. This trip was supposed to be a usual one but it turned out quite the contrary. At first the temperature in our hotel was rather low: we wore sweaters and jackets inside and couldn’t dry up our wet ski costumes. It was nice that there was the hot water in the hotel that didn’t let us freeze at least. The weather was excellent for skiing: sunny and clear. And we had been skiing all day long but when we decided to go to hotel, we found out that cabin-way had broken. A lot of people were made to use the cable-way which had a low carrying capacity. Because of that fact we got stuck in a huge turn for two hours. That day we became frozen hard and didn’t fall ill only because of great dose of the mulled wine. The next day everything started in a good way: we had been skiing until noon, and then we had dinner and continued skiing. I fell behind my friends and went by the cable-away alone. And in the middle of ascent this unlucky cable-way broke down and I got stuck on it. The wind was strong and was becoming stronger; I couldn’t feel my legs and hands. A lot of time had passed before the cable-way was repaired. After descending I met my friend in café and the mull wine brought me back to life again. From that point everything was Ok: there were no mishaps and predicaments. We were skiing all day long and enjoy ourselves a lot. But it wasn’t the end. On the path to home the bus heating broken down. As it was the night trip, everyone couldn’t fall asleep. That’s why we were so tired and exhausted the next morning. Аs a result this trip might seem to be failed but I couldn’t say so. For me it was an adventure with my friends which gave me a lot of vivid recollections and impressions, not as bad as it can look from the outside.\n",

What can it be? Hm... I guess most people like to gossip. Not everyone. For example, my friend Ksenia is unsociable and self-sufficient. It seems she's never bored when she's alone. So she really doesn't care about these small talks. Our classmates all know it. Last week at school Ksenia sat in the chair. She closed her eyes and relaxed. Suddenly she heard two girls, R. and S., who came and sat not far from the place she was. She could hear every word they said. They started to gossip and discuss some pieces of scandal. S. and R. didn't want anyone hear them. They stopped to talk when they saw someone coming nearer. Nevertheless, they didn't pay any attention to Ksu, though it was no doubt they knew she's been there: she waved them hello when they came. They just knew she had no care for gossips and felt free to chat while she's near. But they forgot she had a sick friend, who was extremely bored at home and was out for some news. She told me what she has heard. Don't judge us! Gossips are what the high school was made for. :D Here they are - benefits of being quiet and attracting little attention! --- Today on my English lesson we talked about these funny little sounds and their meaning: Err... = I don't know Oh... = That's annoying Oi = Stop it!

He became famous after his proof of the geometrization conjecture, of which the Poincare conjecture is a particular case. He did it in November 2002. Nobody could solve the famous Poincare conjecture posed in 1904 during all twentieth century. After he published his solution he went out from the science and began to life as ascetic with his mother. He doesn’t communicate with anybody and doesn’t work anywhere. He leads a miserable existence. And it seems that he has problems with the mind. In August 2006, Perelman was awarded the Fields Medal. But he didn’t appear at the ceremony. As he told in his interview he had gone for the mushrooms during this. In March 2010, the first Clay Millennium Prize Problems award was due to him. It seems that he’ll ignore it too.\n",

      "textContent--->novel \"Discovery\" part 8 \tLike all the children, I attended a school, which, in my case, was a few steps from my house. There we were taught various subjects, including absolutely useless ones. We also had to learn a great quantity of bizarre and obscure words... However, I happened to learn another one without even wishing so: scoliosis. I learned this curoius word during a regular medical examination of our school. \tNevertheless, this defect didn’t cause me any inconvenience. Though a little deviation was visible on the X-ray photograph, it didn’t inluence my posture in any way. But, in spite of this fact, I was prescribed medical gymnastics. In a clinic, which was located in the street where I had never been before, existed even a special room for such purposes. \tI was there that I headed/made for. It should be noticed that there were a lot of parks all around these places and a factory that produced tyres. I cannot say exactly whether the trees defeated or not in the struggle that they carried on against this factory for pure air, but such a quantity of greenery was very pleasant to look at. However, during this month of May, not only this attracted my attention. \tWhat can a boy of fifteen think of? The answer is so evident that I’m asking myself if I should give it there. I will simply notice that besides a passion for the opposite sex, I was fond of reading. But you should not believe that I was a library rat: I did judo, played football in the yard of my house with neighbour boys, etc. Simply, shortly before described events, an interesting book had falen into my hands and aroused my interest for reading.

      "textContent--->How to Keep a Stiff Upper Lip. The overwhelming majority of people travel for fun and relaxation, others set of for the sake of photos just to show off, still others leave their homes to expand their knowledge of geography. My case turned out to be unique as I happened to spend a month on learning how to keep your chin up. Indeed, what else can you do if you journey appeared to be a disaster? A few years ago I was invited to spend the following June in Greece taking care of a group children in a summer camp. My imagination conjured up a vision of a sunny day with brilliant blue sky looking down at the unruffled sea. It was so vivid that I could smell the hot air saturated with delicate fragrance of local herbs and flowers richly flavoured with the delicious aroma of roasted coffee coming from a café nearby. I couldn’t think of a better place for being idle and enjoying life to the fullest. The first disappointment I faced was at the airport where we got trapped in the shabbiest and cramped aeroplane, obviously constructed in the previous century. I managed to suppress a wave of panic when the plane eventually took off. ‘Never mind!’ I told myself. ‘There’s something ahead’. Little did I know about what lay in the future. What struck me the moment I stepped inside the tumbledown hotel was the understanding of how insignificant and vulnerable humans could be. Not having been used for long, the building fell in disrepair, no modern conditions provided. Not once was I on the verge of breaking down breathing in the musty smell the bedroom had about it. What added fuel to the fire was the fact that almost all the children had fallen ill leaving no chances for idling or strolling along the beach. At the end of the day I was amazed by how close we had become to each other. I felt as if I could have spent the remainder of my life in that sordid place only to see the children’s faces around beaming and glowing with pride and excitement of helping each other. The only thing was left, the incredible aroma coming from the nearest café, and this was this that made me keep a stiff upper lip.\n",

      "textContent--->motorcycles Hi! Some day ago, while I was roaming through the Internet and found a book by Nick Einch \"Sport driving techniques\" (I didn't find it in English). It discussed everything about driving a motorcycle. Braking, steering, speed selection, possible mistakes, road dangers. Great book. It showed to me a great motorbike world. Bike is much harder than a car. For example, when I need to slow down on a traffic light when driving a car, I select lower gear and push brake pedal. ABS and motor do all things for me. To slow down bike you should slightly push down a rear brake, than, almost immediately activate front brake, also very gentle. After this you can activate front brake as much as possible. Also, while you do all this things you should select lower gear. All this things is to avoid wheels from blocking. If rear wheel will be blocked, the \"highside\" can happen - rear wheel's suspension will push rider out of the saddle. If front wheel will be blocked, raider left any control on the bike. By the way, I really want to ride a bike. It should be hard for the beginning, but it brings a lot of adrenaline and speed. At autumn I'll go to auto-school to get 'A' category driving license. There are some bike photos. http://autobm.ru/glr/%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%8B/126-1.jpg http://www.cycleworld.com/assets/image/2009/W28/070620091741059994.jpg http://assets0.smart.fm/assets/users/tmp120210/21f0d7e8.jpg after days of reading test-drives, reviews, etc. I found Kawasaki Ninja 250R.

Their members sang sincerely, and the whole audience knew their songs by heart and sang along. Skunk Anansie played extremely professionally. Their singer Skin even jumped in the crowd! I couldn't hear Tarja because my friends and I have frozen. That's why we decided to go home.

Our biggest surprise was that he was a man! :D but then we saw him and became very dissapointed, because he was not attractive and young)) but when we started a lesson, we were shocked. He is a military simultaneous interpreter, and interpreter in the oil industry sphere. He speaks English so clearly, fastly, without our accent, in short, he was excellent. He told us to buy many books for work by them, so... we'll have plenty of work.)) And now I have to learn my french, pour faire mon devoir.))) I have many DEBTS, if it's possible to say so, such as verses, songs and texts that I had to learn by heart and hand in, but I hadn't do it, because I was lazy. It was my mistake! Oh, in these moments I hate french))))\n",
      "textContent--->novel \"Discovery\" part 9 \tAfter a little bus trip pending twenty minutes and a few minutes of shady malls and sunny parks, I entered dark clinical corridor, where some children and adolescents were waiting for their lot/fate. I took my place on a backless seat near a girl who seemed to be of the same age as me. As the corridor was only lighted up by a little window in the end of it and as I did not dare speak to her, I only saw her vague profile that I looked secretly at. \tA large mirror occupied all the wall of the room in which we entered soon after my arrival. I saw myself clearly in the mirror as well as the young girl who seemed to me very pretty, but this spectacle did not last long. The woman doctor, either for observing security or for another reason, took away my glasses and put them down on her table promising to give them back just after the session. I was so surprised at this impertinence that I even did not have time to say a word. \tThe following half an hour turned out plunged in the fog. If with my glasses I had been able to see perfectly a text written on a blackboard even from the last school desk, without them every object two metres away from me appeared to me to be nothing but a coloured stain. Until now I remember my sitting on a rug, opposite the mirror, in the middle of these unknowns among who I was feeling her presence: and also the light wind from a window, song of birds outside, soon we would have the school exams and after that would start the summer holidays... \tWhen I emerged from this fog, in other words when my glasses were given back to me, all of us were already in the act of changing from our sport shoes into casual shoes and because it took me a good deal of time, I went out into the street among the lasts. \tOutside, after leaving all these fogs and sombre clinical corridors, I was breathing with surprising lightness. What had been difficult in the darkness, seemed so much simpler in the light: I would only catch up with this girl over there, say words of greeting... It was precisely what I did. And I was fully recompensed with her charming smile and with all the charm of youth expressed on the face of this girl of fourteen.\n",
      "textContent--->voices vs. instruments I was wondering, everybody knows there are low voices and high voices as well as instruments playing in low and high register. and the sound comes from something vibrating - a string as in a violin or air as in a trumpet. you pluck a thick string with a finger and get a low sound, say an E on the guitar (the 6th string). you pluck a thinner string and get a higher note, an A on the 5th string. or you hold the thicker 6th string on fret five, thus making it shorter, and, again, get the higher A note. so, obviously, the thicker and longer the vibrating body (string or air column), the lower the pitch. the thinner / shorter the vibrating body, the higher the pitch. that's why the strings on a bass guitar are thicker than the guitar's, or why the violin's are thicker and longer than the cello's. that's also why the trombone is straight and the tuba so twisted: to play as low as it does, it must be longer than the trombone, but you could not hold it in your hands if it were as straight. so, as it goes, size does matter. now, what I don't understand is the difference between human voices: how come men in general sing (and speak, too) lower than women, how come men sing tenor or bass, how come women sing alto or soprano, if we all are relatively the same size? I mean, you cannot say, the tall or the fat ones sing lower, and it's rather the size of just a part of your body it must come up to, where there is the less difference. well, I know, there is the air you breath through the throat, just like through the flute - is this where length or width differ? there are also the vocal cords, that vibrate under that breathing air as strings do under your fingers - are these so different in size? or is it something else I didn't come to think of? and even if there is a difference in size between a bass singer's and a soprano singer's organs, isn't it too damned small to produce pitch variations like this? I mean, look at the violin and cello. their playing ranges overlap: a cello can play in unison with the violin, the former's high notes are the latter's low ones, but that's alright. what I'm driving at, is their pitch is comparable, but their size is not. or take the two saxophones, soprano, the size of a clarinet, and baritone, bent in two halves and still reaching to the floor from a seated player's mouth. they both, too, can play several notes in the same pitch. whereas, my baritone voice (or bass, I don't know exactly which) cannot always sing a tenor's part, forget about an alto's. okay, I can't, this might be due to lack of professional training, but a singer who can, is celebrated rather as an exception, like my worshiped idol Bobby McFerrin. so, if you find an article explaining this in simple words or can put it in words of your own for a thankful word in return, you are welcome to come and open my eyes=)\n",

If it's serious then good-working bar-staff are going to be completely drunk in the end of their shift. Maybe they don't drink it on the work, and take it to their home? Then they have to have a lot of little empty bottles. This version don't look convincing. Maybe they sell it in the bar to next clients? Then why don't they take a money as a tip?

Since early childhood he has lived in the world of musical sounds and melodies. His parents noticed their son’s musical abilities and his interest to music and bought him a synthesizer. When he came to this school he began studying at the musical school. First he was engaged in playing the piano, then the accordion Sasha is lucky to be taught by wonderful teachers Lyudmila Tyukalova and Lyubov Poplavskikh.

It was even easier to read that book because I’d gotten used to the Carroll’s vocabulary. But there were lots of plays on words, it made things a little more difficult. There are many translations of the books about Alice into Russian. I wonder what they did with all those plays on words? I thought about possible ways to translate them into Russian while I was reading those books and found that it’s often impossible! Actually, translations of poetry, books and movies sometimes are really awful. Especially movie’s ones. When I see films in English translated into Russian I’m often really shocked about HUGE quantities really STUPID mistakes. Have you ever noticed anything like that?\n",
      "textContent--->Gossip Through the first paragraph of the short story named “Gossip” we make the acquaintance of the main character, Fred Battersby. He calls around on a number of married women and treats them equally, paying exactly the same amount of attention to each one. “What a womanizer!” we may infer. But further the author gives a detailed description of Fred’s visitings. He is a middle-aged widower with a pleasant face which inspires to trust him. Being conscious of what ladies want and capable of giving them what they need, Fred devotes himself to their problems and he indeed likes it. Moreover, he is such a rare man, who not only enjoys being with a women, but can understands them. And he is very good at it. In other words, he does the things which husbands are supposed to do: listening to wives’ problems, giving compliments and making them feel essential, helping them out and taking an interest in their doings, even sometimes flirting with them and amusing them. The ladies appreciate Fred and they are always looking forward to his visitings. But his calls do not go unnoticed and eventually cause rumours to spread through the small village, where it is impossible to hide any secrets. Propelled by the idea of keeping welfare and morality in the town, the older village women, thinking of disclosing Fred’s affairs, backbites him. The worst of these gossips, Mr. and Mrs. Summershams, unfortunately have not only long tongues and desire to maintain the “order”, but also resources and power to do it. The atmosphere of distrust grows up, and thereupon the Summershams motive the director of company where Fred works to dismiss him. He has nothing to do but move to a nearby village; the scandal is subsided, delighted gossips and offended husbands calm down. The peace has settled not for long. The ladies, bereft of Fred, begin to find a replacement, but noting can substitute his former rounds. And that leads to real cheatings, divorces and new wave of worse rumors. The story is centered around gossiping and backbiting. And the main message of the story is ‘avoiding rumours’, which is strongly highlighted in the concluding words. This story is a vivid example of gossiping with all its terrible and irreparable consequences. Particularly when it comes to people with power, who can act, being guild only by unreliable hearsay information. On the other hand, it partially tells about husbands, wrapped in theirselves and therefore unable to pay necessary amount of attention to their wives. The main character Fred, calling round on the women and absorbing all their negative energy, helps to avoid important problems and keeps the families safe. He is definitely a man of merit. Thus, I suspect, it also contains a message to each of husbands, who after reading the story should reflect upon it and a situation in his own family.\n",

      "textContent--->First post. Hello, world! :) Today I'll try to tell you about russian system of education. This theme is very close to me: i have graduated institute last year and going to enter a post graduate course. Russian system of education is being reformed nowadays: from our own system, we are coming to the Bolognese system. Let's start with russian original system. In Russia (and other in former soviet republics) we divided education into several main stages: elementary school, secondary school, higher school and then science degrees are coming. Elementary school consists of three or four forms (from first to fourth. Fourth one can be omitted ), secondary school consist of five forms (from fifth to ninth). I would say, higher school should be divided into two main part: two highest forms in schools and five or six years of institute (or university). After elementary school pupils are able to read, write, count. After secondary school pupils can do everything mentioned above, their math skills are hardened, they should know basic physics, chemistry, biology, at least one foreign language, geography, history and may be some basic philosophy. At this point pupil get high education. Many people stops at this point: high education is enough for life ;) Almost everyone in Russia graduates from high school. Higher school is much more difficult to enter and to graduate. So it was very prestigious to have higher education. Nowadays bribery prospers everywhere, so higher education lost most of its prestige. Nevertheless, after higher school you receive a title of a specialist. As a specialist you are considered to be able to solve difficult abstract and applied problems, to be skillful at your speciality, to be able to do economic forecast, concerning your projects. But in every institute or university students learn a wide range of sciences. For example, as an engineer (a programmer), I had to learn russian language (a bit), philosophy, an arrangement of semiconductor devices, theory of problems solving and many other thing, I don't really use in everyday work. Last term in higher school is almost totally devoted to a degree work. In this work you should propose some minor improvement of something already invented (can I say \"being used\"?). After higher school students can go for a higher academic degrees. In russian system these are \"candidate of a science\" and \"doctor of a science\". In brief, to become a candidate of a science, you have to compose existing things, ideas to a some new system, to archive a  solution of a fundamental problem. To become a doctor of a science, you have to propose something really new to the science (or convince everyone, that you proposed something new). Next time, I'll try to write something about novelties in russian education. P. S. I didn't expect, I would need a dictionary so many times.\n",

      "textContent--->The Lovely Bones. Alice Sebold. The life after Susie Salmon’s death, the ordinary girl with mousy brown hair, is the central event of this story. She was fourteen when she was murdered on December 6, 1973. Her murder was a man from their neighborhood, Mr. Harvey. The tense plot overlaps with a miracle place called Heaven, where Susie spend her time after the death and tracks this world where her family tried to overcome with their grief. Susie had the opportunity to observe how her dearth has affected to her family, murder and those who had been around her. On December 6, Susie takes a short-cut through the cornfield back from the junior high. She was trying to taste a snowflake when she saw Mr. Harvey. He invited her to look at the hole in the earth, which he built for the kids in the neighborhood. Those snowing winter’s night little girl Susie was raped and murdered. After her death, Ray Singh became the first suspect, the first and only boy who loved Susie. Later he proved his alibi. Susie was trying to go to the duplex with her father and show him who the real murder was. Her father, Jack Salmon, who goes crazy with grief over the loss of his lovely daughter, began to suspect Mr. Hervey. But he has no proof. This is a cleverly constructed novel which can be separated into two parts. The first part is like mystery story where Susie was murdered and after that live in her heaven with Franny, a middle aged woman who becomes Susie and Holly's mentor, and a little girl Holly. The second part is mostly becomes pure story, where Susie continues to watch how lives her family and think about her murder, trying to understand why it happened. The book is written in a style accessible to the teenagers. The language is plain in the best tradition of story-telling but at the same time it’s contain detective style. Sebold’s descriptions of afterlife and relation between people who lost the most important treasure are beautifully observed.\n",

      "textContent--->Nosferatu Yesterday I saw a movie, directed by Vernor Herzog, it called \"Nosferatu\". The story tells us about young english gentleman who should go (how to say it more poetic about \"making the trip\"/\"going for adventorous trip\"?) to Transilvania in case to make a deal with duke Dracul on real estate. On his way to Carpatian mountains he meets gypsies who warn him from this trip telling scaring legends about Dracula and his mysterious castle. But his not that type of man to be scared by these stories. He arrives to the castle and meets there dead-white duke (I mean, his face is very white) who treat him very well. But during the dinner Jonathan accidentally cuts his finger, in this very intense moment duke catchs his hand and sucks the blood. Actually this movie isn't scary, most of all it presents an interesting novel (script) with dramatic landscape and decorations of XIX century (I suppose so). Expressive acting and static picture remains of those black&white silent movies of early XX century.

Her grandfather was a champion. In the first day we bought some milk and special kitty food. She mew loudly in the car when we transfered her to our house. You will not believe but she was happy when we came home. Moreover she has found a cat's toilet. She is a clever kitty. On the other hand she is bit silly. I can tell you about her character. It is very calm when she meets but very active when she plays. Today was the first day when she lives alone in the room. When I came from the work, she was sleeping. Furthermore the climat of our room became more favourable and claim.\n",

I'm so envy with early risers. I wish I could remove my English study and another routines that connected to the computer from night time to the early morning time. Because in the mornings I limited with my time in front of computer by necessity to go to work. But in the evening sometimes it's too difficult to come off computer. I know how important to sleep. But it must be the most boring thing in the world. Actually I've written this post just to drop here two lines.

      "textContent--->taking exams hey. now that i've screwed up my first exam, i've been making up excuses for myself, which is actually not so bad after all ('you're a blundering idiot' would be an excuse fair enough, and would probably give me motivation, too), the problem is, the excuses i make are kind of... cheap. what i've been telling myself are things that are neither useful nor true, things like 'at least i am good-looking' and 'nice guys finish last', and... well, you get the idea. the problem is, pedagogical tricks do not really work with me. i wish they would, i really really really do, but hell, they don't. instead of getting angry and pissed off and working hard to succeed at the next exam, i am sitting at this cafe, smoking a cigarette lazily and making up irrelevant excuses. ans even that would be okay, if only there was something else, something i would be very, very good at, something i could be proud of, something that could, you know, compensate, make other things unimportant, make me go 'who cares about this pedagogy anyway' not in a trying-to-make-myself-believe-it kind of way but in a just-stating-the-truth kind of way. all i want is to be worthwhile, or do something that is worthwhile i'm no longer sure i'm in the right place after all, man i'm no longer sure there is a right place\n",
      "textContent--->Stephen Fry on Languages and BBC's Coming Documentary Series Part 1 I've decided to follow my friend's advice and do comprehension checks. This time I've chosen Stephen Fry's monologue. It turned out to be really long, but if you are interested in Stephen Fry or languages, please help me with it. I don't know anything about French, so I've typed the words intuitively, sorry. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2P6DcSyon4&feature=player_embedded Up to 06:20 We come to count to… to talk about that amongst other things but it's the, it's the one that's going first of all in our projects. It's documentary series, a five part documentary series for the BBC and the rest of the world, naturally. And it's about language. Language and languages, everything to do with it, really, that we can cram into five hours. Obviously, you'll need fifty hours or five hundred hours to cover every extraordinary thing about this gift that all humans have, this thing that is part of being human like a passable thumb. It's one of the clear markers that make us distinct from other creatures on the earth as far as we can tell. It's about language. And language is the thing, the gift. It's what the French have a good distinction “lernen parol(?)”. There's language that the structure, the thing that we all can do and there is this instance of it that I'm using now which happens to be in English. You know, it's like there is chess. Do you play chess? What do you think of chess? And there is a particular game of chess going on at any one moment. And so language, as I say, is common to the all mankind. And it is mysterious our origins, really, and so partly we'll be to try to understand how it grew in us, when it developed within our brains, was it the trigger that made us really the special species that we are. Which is a tautology special species, isn't it? Is it the counter of the ______ of our moving out of Tanzanian Canyon into the whole of the rest of the world? Did that happen at the same time as the origin? How did all languages divide in the way sense the races divide from Caucasian to…into Caucasian and so on. And then there are all kinds of issues of language. Languages can be used for almost anything. I'm using it now to transell(?) as the documentary series about language but it's also used to seduce, to flatter, to change people's minds, to whip people up, to cause _______ of hatred or love. And there is transgressive language, language of swearing and language of inappropriateness as we'd now call it in taboo words and so on. Swearing in our culture, we take it of course because it's so deep in our bones that we are shocked by certain words, but the mostly words that refer to parts of the human body that connected to excretion and copulation. There is nothing reasonable about that at all, it's completely mysterious. And if you were an alien and you were looking down at the planet, you would say “What are the things that this species does that the most shaming and appalling? What's about they torture children, they kill, they abuse?”. So presumably words like torture and kill, and cruel would be the taboo words, because they refer to the disgusting things that humans do. The nice thing they do is, well, they make babies, they continue their species in acts of love and spasms of joys. So those would be really good words. __________the reverse. You can say “I was in the traffic, it was cruel, it was torture!” and nobody turns a hair and you refer into the worst things we do, but just say a word vaguely connected to the lavatory area and people go pink and say “How you dare to talk like that?” It's so strange! There is no reason for that. It goes back to genesis in the Judaic Christian culture. It is the first point about genesis is the shame and shame at _____, shame at those parts of the body. Adam and Eve didn't said “Oh, my God! We are naked, we must cover our noses.” or “We must cover our knees.” They immediately went for the areas that will do with genital things. So it seems to be deep ____. It's not universal, I mean, even in Europe it isn't. It's actually quite hard to shock someone speaking Flemish Dutch by using parts of the body. It will be like shouting: “You, nostril!” OK, I'm nostril. And say, if you call them anything to do with your privet areas. They'll go: “Yeah, OK”. I mean they're sort of familiar with the fact that in our culture it's very rude. People have this idea that language degrades, that somehow it's less pure even within a lifetime. And that what young people say some is sloppy or it's not good, or that there is a proper style of language. I don't believe any of that; I think it's complete nonsense. I think one can speak elegantly and beautifully in almost any discourse you choose. But I think it's also the nature of English but other languages to, particularly English, because of its historical importance since really the 19th century when Britain's _______ all the way to Americans taking over that mental and the use of English as the international language of everything from aviation to the Internet,   is that it is a mongrel language both in a philological sense in its origins of Saxon(?) and Frisian(?), and Judaic(?) languages and obviously the Romans languages Latin and Greek, but also within that it's a mongrel. Every time someone who speaks English, opens their mouth, whether they know it or not they tend to be repeating phrases from Milton and Shakespeare, and Chaucer but also from nautical and legal, and  gangster, and criminal, and all kinds of discourses, all jostling together. It's a little like London. London is the city where you're on the same street you have the 17th century building next to a 13th century building next to a 21st century building and some people think that's impure. In France, for example, where a zone in Paris is incredibly protected within the parific(?) they have old grand proge(?), but generally speaking it's a museum and their language is the same, because they have academy France and they protect the language as they see that as the right thing for French. When English is much more organic and it changes and it's full of Americanisms, full of Australian isms and now full of all kinds of mixtures of that.\n",

In the letter you were interested in my hobby and interests. Yes, I really consider myself a very vigorous and active person. I like all new; a good company;  and to active in life; to visit new places. But it doesn’t mean that there is not enough romanticism in me. Like you I like to be alone, to set with my best girl-friend  in a cosy café and talk about something, for a long time, to walk in the evenings  on the river bank, in the park or in other romantic places. I do love such moments in my life. And what about you? As for my hobbies, you’ve probably guessed that I love art strongly. Especially dances!!! They  help me to my energy to the necessary channel, to show myself off on the stage and to keep  sit . This is my spirit!:) And  I consider that dance quite well. What do you think of it? And still I like to sing for myself. I don’t enjoy singing on the stage very much. These are my hobbies. I hope, it was interesting to you learn about me something new.

      "textContent--->Birth and Death Rates The line graph presents the data on total population, mortality and fertility rates in England and Wales during the period 1700 to 2000. At the beginning of the18th century there were 5.5 million people living in Wales and England, with 30 million live births per 1,000 of the population and 36 million death rate. Remaining steady over a century, since 1800 the population rose nearly tenfold reaching 52m. Birth rate, climbed by 5m in 1750, then plunged sharply till 9m, and in the 19th century there was a significant recover (20m). Nevertheless, by 2000 the ratio of births amounted to exactly 10 millions. During the period of three centuries mortality rate always exceeded natality, accounted for 36m in 1700 and then fluctuated downwards to 11 millions. Over the period as a whole, there was a significant increase in the population and a marked decrease in the birth and death rates.\n",

      "textContent--->Nice Meditation Camp Have you ever heard about Dharma? Dharma is Buddha's doctrine which Buddishes use as a living principle. During 30th April-3rd May, I and my friends in the faculty of Medicine have an opportunity to go to a Dharma retreat named \"แสงธรรมส่องชีวิต\" (Saeng Dham Song Chewit),at Parkchong district, Nakhonrachasrima province located in the north-eastern of Thailand. At first, I'm not interested or enthusiastic to go to that place. But when I arrived, the first thing which made me stunned was a very requisite environment. The landscape was very spectacular just like tourist attractions in the northern of Thailand, because the Dharma retreat was surrounded by a massif. The climate was so fine. A little cold wind blew over a meditation hall. It was cold even if it was a Summer in Thailand which everybody know that is very hot. Everything made me feel happy and serene. The first thing we had planed to do was having a lunch. We had a lunch with a happy mood, because the meal was very delicious. Cooks intended to cook every meal for people who intended to come here. Every meal was a vegetarian food that encouraged people not to encroach animals. Everyone enjoyed eating so much. Then, let me tell you about practicing. We woke up at 4.00am that was very early for all of us. The things we had to do were praying, do meditation and walking meditation. Walking meditation made us conscious and not negligent, especially while we were walking through the path, not only the walking path, but also the path of life. we had walked until the sun risen. After that, we went to listened to  monks teaching about Dharma. The monks were able to explain the Dharma lessons to be easy to learn and understand. We liked to listen to the Dharma lessons, although we were just teenagers. Most of contents were about how to be a good human and a nice doctor. And most of them were suitable for  all of us who would be a doctor in the future. I think that going to this Meditation Camp has given me a priceless experience and made me know how to lead the life happily and peacefully. I think if you guys have an opportunity to go there, you will have a happier life for sure.\n",

      "textContent--->My Elementary Education First of all, this subject reminds me of the very croel thing,which is the passing of time that we,all mankind, have to face . The elementary school, that I went to, was I a Christian school called Pajasub School. It's located on Ratchadaphisek road in Bangkok. When I was in grade1, I was selected to be in the Christian's class for some mistake reason because I am Bhuddist. I had to sing and pray some kind of Christian stuff. I was the only  bhuddist student in that class ,so I felt a little nervous at the beginning of the semester but everything is going just fine. I could adapt myself well. When I was an elementary student,I didn't pay attention in the education so much. I was just mocking around with my friends playing some kind of marble game at the playground. After I finished Grade2,the very important thing occured to me. I was nominated to be in the most cleverest student's class. And that changed my education a lot. I could say it changed my life as well. I was starting to pay more attention in the education since then and I had been in that top class 7 years in a row untill I finished the Junior High. After that I went to the most famous high school in Thailand, Triamudom Suksa School,which I could not maintain being in the top class anymore.\n",

      "textContent--->What is your bad point? Right now, my German and Japanese skills are not as good as I expect because of a lack of use and practice. So, I’m now trying to brush up my knowledge by reading books and doing self-study about these languages. Or I should talk about something else, like... I’m a person who prefers to get everything perfectly done, and I sometimes find myself in trouble because of too much perfectionism. For example, when I was a sophomore, I spent too much time on doing assignment since I expected to be the best, so I couldn’t meet the deadline. After that, I’ve improved myself by prioritizing the tasks and managing the time to make sure that my work is completed on time. Thank you :) \n",

      "textContent--->If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? As the old adage goes, change is inevitable. It is often for better and cannot be done overnight, which means it could takes much effort. If there could be one thing that I need to change for my home town, I would want to change all corrupt practices and political unrest existing in my country at the present. In this essay, I’d like to give my reasons for above statements in following sentences. Firstly, corruption is part of Thai society for very long time and takes place at every level in government from front-office clerks to minister. For example, this can happen in a way that contracts of government projects can be bought by companies involved in bidding processes, which can be harmful for development of country. Yet, some groups of people even believe that corrupt government can be accepted as long as it can make them eat and sleep well through some corrupt government’s populist policy. That can be very wrong idea because in reality there is no such country in the world that prospers by corruption. Therefore, I'd like to get rid of corruption for a good future in both economy and quality of life for the whole country.\n",

Do they right? 3. What could you say to express to your friends that you are giant abortion because you believe it is form of murder? - In my opinion, I think abortion is not right, because it means killing someone. 4 Your friends think that an unborn baby is not a human being. You dont agree. What could you say to tell your friends that you dont agree? - I think your point are not convince. Since you know that you are going to have baby. It means that baby have already heart likes human being. 5. What could you say to try to convince your friends that abortion should not be legalized in Thailand? - I think abortion is not the right way to solve their problems. On the other hand, it would be more other problems of Thai sociey. You all can share your ideas together.\n",

      "textContent--->Favourite sport Nowadays many people spend most of their time on work. I could say that they forgot something important like exercise and sport. Sport is an important thing because it can give you a better health. I strongly believe that the harder you exercise, the more calories you’ll burn overall. Moreover, Women can get natural beauties without the use of diet pills and drugs. I love lots of sports, such as, baseball, cricket, motor racing and swimming. I like to swim but it is less fun than baseball. The one that I like most is baseball so my favorite sport is definitely Baseball. Baseball is a sport in which two teams meet for a period of 9 innings score points by hitting a leather ball with a large bat and then successfully making it around 3 bases and finishing by running over. The initial starting point. Baseball is a lot more than just hitting a ball and running around bases, and that is what makes it so much fun to play. Baseball requires strategy and physical fitness to succeed at it. It takes one who can play as a team person and look out for more than just himself. Baseball requires at least 9 players on the field at all times when on defense. There are 9 positions on the field. The last sport I want to talk about is Football. Ever since I was young my favorite sport to watch has been Football and I know many people also like football. In my opinion, football is the funniest sport to watch. In conclusion my most favorite sport is baseball and I also have swimming and Football as my second and third favorite sports.\n",

      "textContent--->SUMMARY: The pernicious pinkification of little girls \tAntonia Senior, in her article “The Pernicious pinkification of little girls,” explains the pinking process of girlhood which changes girls’ attitude to interest in beauty and fancy world rather than focusing on education and future career. Nowadays, every child’s stuffs were categorized into two genders, for boys and for girls. Girls’ stuffs let little girls to value princesses as their role models. However, they don’t admire the wise and brave princesses but the girlish, pretty, pinky, soft, and sweet princesses. Toys and clothes emphasize the importance of being feminine. This girly process is increasingly widespread. There are so many stuffs produced for girls only such as girls’ jeans with butterflies and hearts. The process is not about beautiful things only, but it affects girls’ attitude to learning. Even girls graduate from schools and enroll in colleges more than boys, boys still beat girls when it comes to spatial skills like maths and sciences. The gender-stereotyped idea makes boys and girls limit themselves to gender-specific subjects according to their own value. Besides, when women graduate, they leave the bright future in a good-positional job to marry men. These show the women’s attitude which is influenced by fairy tales when they are little girls. The gender-stereotyped idea settles on their mind. So all that women really concern about are looking good, being feminine, and ending up with a good guy. The girls’ view of the world comes out like this partly because of girly, princessy, fairy things that suggest them since they are little child. Therefore, the real cause of this pinking process is the way their parents guide them to be. Parents are the one who nurture their own girls by surrounding them with those girly stuffs that give them some attitude about how to live.\n",

If in the future we assume that everyone has a car. Compared to the past car buying is very simple today. Car sales company uses a variety of techniques to persuade customers to buy a car. With attractive promotions such as free first class insurance, pay by installments with 0% interest for first-three years included a lot of premium with one year warranty. It becomes obvious that everyone can have a car. Even though Bangkok now has Sky train Subway and BRT, bus rapid service, but the construction still not cover the ultimate areas and Cause the amount of car on the road increased continuously. Especially during the prime time traffic congestion in Bangkok gets even worse. In summary, I think the government should have the ability to formulate new policies with potential action.

      "textContent--->Thailand Thailand is located in the center of South East Asia. It is the world's 50th largest country, with an area as large as France. The capital and the most crowded city of Thailand is Bangkok. According to the latest survey of National Statistical Office, the number of Thai people is estimated at 65 million. In the old days, Thailand had a formal name called \"Siam\" but was changed to \"Thailand\" later in 1939. The word \"Thai\" is actually a name of an ethnic group from the central plain. It doesn't mean \"Freedom\" like it is generally believed. Even though Thailand's name is not involved with liberty, in an agelong history of Thailand, Thailand is the only South East Asian nation that has never been colonized from powerful western countries.\n",

I had never done monthly expense records over 2 weeks, because I often forgot what I bought and sometimes bored to record it on bookkeeping everyday. I though it was not important to do it. After I have done with a monthly account record, I felt good to see how money lefts each day. I saw what I buy in each day , and I could take the nonsense things away. In addition, I have got more money lefts at the end of month, and I deposited it in bank account . When I see the number in deposit passbook increase, I will happy so much. Anyways, there was an unbelievable. I sometimes spent not over 100 baht per day. I could do it about a half of month. Generally, I spent  one hundred and something.

Some of my friends said that there is too little time to study but I think it was ok because if the class is too long I'll become sleepy anyway. There are 3 months in one term and after each term we'll have to take a replacement test. If we did good we could skip the next class and go on with more higher level. As a result, I have a new text book every three months ^^and also new teachers. All of the teachers I have studied with, everyone has their own style and their own teaching method which I'm kind of impressed. For example, Ateacher often tell stories other than in the book and always teaches new vocabularies, Bteacher could explain a complicated articles so that it seems easy, Cteacher is very enthusiastic well I don't know how she did but I've never felt drowsy in her class and so did others... and so on Talking about students, a lot of students come from China and Korea. The other students come from Thailand, Burma, Srilanga, Russia, and some European countries. Since today is a special day, I made some chocolate and brought it to school.

      "textContent--->First Entry Hi, everybody. I am a newbie here. I know of Lang-8 from Ask. antimoon. com—a Q&A site for language learners. I am very excited to know that there is a site like this. It's like a dream come true for me (and I am not exaggerating!). I have always wished that I could improve my English skills by writing journal entries and having someone correct them for me. I used to think that, if I had a lot of money, I would pay a native speaker teacher to correct my writing. Now I don't need to have that much money anymore because Lang-8 is free. Well, not exactly free, because I am obliged to check other people's journal entries written in Thai—my native language—as well. Right now I know so little about Lang-8. I haven't read the help section yet. In fact, currently I don't have much time. I am trying to get a scholarship to study abroad, so most of my time should be spent on preparing for the exam I'll be taking in another 12 days. It's only a slim chance because I haven't begun studying for it yet. But I'm going to do my best. Writing this entry takes me quite a long time. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this now, considering how little time I have left before the test. But I can't help it. When I knew of this site last night I felt so excited that I must experiment with it today. It will be quite some time before I write another entry. Feel free to correct any mistakes you spot. Feel free to comment.\n",

Our class is really boring. My teacher normally came late about 15-30minutes. He's always making an excuse that this was because of  traffic jam but he never said that this's because he had played games all of the night. He's always talking about his hobbies, showing us his photos, talking about what joy that you uses when you play games but he rarely talked about our lessons. I don't want to compare him to my previous english teacher Adelina who had gone to Dubi. He's different league with her. Thank you for tolerating to listen to my boring story.\n",
      "textContent--->The Elite Subordinate First of all, I work for the Royal Thai Navy and my post is on the mine hunting ship named Tha Din Daeng. I was graduated 4 years ago, it was not a long time but long enough for me to discover something,significant by observing the behaviors of my subordinates. From the observation, there is a similarity in the group of persons, who seem to be not pay attention in their work and prefer joking around and laugh loudly while others were working. I found that the operational capability of this kind of  persons tend to be far more higher than the regular ones. At the first time, I was not so sure about this notice because there was an exception in one person, who works regularly but has the highest operational capabity in the ship, he can fix almost every mechanical failures which occurs during the operation. I thought it might be a coincident and try not to jump to the conclusion. Later on, I was informed that the highest capability man used to be a misbehaviour too, a long time ago. That information assures my notice. However, it was just a notice and I didn't run any experiment to support ,so it might just be corresponding  only in my ship. The experiment needed to be run to find out whether or not this theory is true.\n",

HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR 2009. MAY YOUR LIFE ALWAYS BE FILLED WITH LOVE, HAPPINESS, PROSPERITY,SERENITY, AND FIRM IN ALL ASPECTS. BE CONSCIOUS! LEE\n",

We might encounter the problem about Anglish (Asian English, my vocab) accent like Singlish. Thai listening skill is poorer than reading skill. Since we have many textbooks available in English but a few English native speakers to communicate with. Thai student often speak with wrong pronucation but Thai people can understand Thai English or Asian English pronunciation easier from circumstance. Writing skill is the worst skill for Thai student. Since we don't have anyone to correct grammatic sentence and tell how different between right and wrong grammar. Grammar is the hardest part for writing an essay. Many students need the native speaker to correct their English in university life, even the reader is Thai viewer. How hard of this! Thank you for everyone who help me to correct my English. I wish one day I will write and speak fluently in English not Anglish.\n",
      "textContent--->Family and career Family is the small unit of society. Everyone has their own family, it could be simply one like husband and wife, parent and son, or even expanded family like grandparent, father, mother and children. People said that good society should start from good family that take care of their own responsibilities. Thai family has strong relationship between cousin, uncle, aunt, niece and nephew. This reason might be we have agricultural structure. We have to plant rice field together, live in one large homeland from parent. The situation and life make us more relationship with our relatives. Career is one goal for life. People would like to have their own careers  which they can earn money and  dignity. Once we have civilization city, people go to seeking better salary and high payment in capital city. Now career make us leave our own hometown and family. The intelligent child left home to study in a capital school since they were a teenager. This lead them to keep continue their career in big city like Bangkok. Some people decided to achieve their life by going back home then start the new life near their family, this make them feel warm in heart when they need any support and the family provide a big hand. Family and career are two things in our life that everyone has to balance with. It will complicate when people change their status to marriage, widow, or devorce. Someone has a good idea that people who success in career and life because they start family first so they can focus on their career. It meant that they firstly married in young age and build up a family, during the first couple year they have a baby. While the wife has to take care baby during husband is responsible for main financial support. The man can work hard at the beginning life, if it progress well they get promotion in the firm or the business. Afterthat they should reschedule time for mentoring to his employee or even their child. This seems a good suggestion for life. The good reason is that when you success in your career, at least you have someone share your happiness and smile to you when you get back from work.\n",

      "textContent--->Horizon is in front of me I have been studying English a year and a half ago. Now I'm quite far from the starting point but still very far away from expert. Every times I'm look back, I'm feel great, bigger than before and not a dumb anymore Even though I still can't use it fluently, at least seeing the target make you have more power. I'm always glad when I think that \"If I have not been doing it since that day, today I must still be a lousy guy for sure. I'm feel big when compare myself to the others, especially my friends at the same age. For me, English language is the very powerful device. I can read many good books (even if now I can just read a few books, my feat isn't enough yet) , reach a lot of great website , get more fun when watch some movie , make friends with foreigners (Now I have some from Burmese, Japan and America, all from lang-8) or even get a better salary. It's like a door of freedom. In the future, more or less I think it must be a money magnet for me. To day I always try to engulf the big bunch of vocab then a few months later, found it dissipate from my head lol. But the most terrible thing is Grammar, especially Tense always sicken me. I think the ones who learn Thai or the another must feel the same. I think Thai Grammar must be tougher than English, fortunately I understand it. Looking forward to hear you comment about learning language or something and thanks in advance for correction. Any advice from any nation is welcome. You also can meet me on Facebook by search mumagagi@hotmail. com . Thank you very much indeed.\n",
      "textContent--->Essay about online learning I was going to enroll an online academic writing course. So, I was supposed to submit them a diagnostic essay to see if i am capable for the class, which is a bit advanced. However, I have decided to take TOEFL writing course instead since I have planned on taking a TOEFL and wanted to improve my English writing in general such as grammartical syntex and basic writing organization, not a critical thinking which is taught in an academic writing class (I might take it when I finish this class). Here is the essay. It could be boring but that is why we call it academic, I presume? Anyway, This is my masterpiece so far because I had not ever finished any essay I wrote in english :( PROMPTS: Please write a short passage, about 300 words, telling me what you think about online learning. Have you taken an online course before? What do you think about online courses in general? What do you think are the benefits of taking an online course? What are the disadvantages? Any other thoughts on this topic?   I have never taken an online course before but I am interested to take one. Since I have had to focus on my family, taking an online course seems to be a best idea to achieve knowledge because it provides flexibility and convenience. These are, in my opinion, some benefits of online learning. First, there is no necessary to physically attend classrooms. Online courses are very suitable for people who are uncomfortable to travel due to their locations or their personal physical problems and so on. It saves time and sometimes it saves money. Students can get on their computers at any hour on any day at home and do not need to pay for travel to a class. Second, Online courses are self-paced with flexible schedules. Students can catch up class work any time and it can be scheduled around work and family. Third, Online courses are more privacy. There is no distraction for people who always feel intimidated or shy when place in traditional classroom. As a result, those people would feel more confident and can be learnt more effectively. In a contrary way, there are disadvantages of taking an online course, too. As I mentioned that online courses are self-paced, it could be very easy for student to neglect course assignments. Moreover, without being in instructors’ sight, it also could be very easy for student to cheat; to copy answers, to have someone else do their assignments. With cheating, students are never able to know their true potentials and they would not be able to properly improve their skills. Online learning is portable and flexible but it is not for everyone. With being independent, Students can easily get distracted. Therefore, online learners have to remain motivated and stay on task to prevent themselves falling behind.\n",

      "textContent--->Animal testing  Animal testing is used for helping people and animals from disease. There are three main areas of research, that is Basic or pure research, drug testing and cosmetic testing. The scientist has studied about the good medical advances from animals. However, people are against. There are some misunderstand about animal testing. First, they believe that dogs, cats, and monkey are mainly use in research. In fact, scientist mostly uses rats and mice which is born and raised for research. Second, they believe that the more expand biomedical research, the more animals are used. It is just only 10 percent of research includes with animals. They offer the alternatives include “lab-grown cells and organs ,and  human clinical tests.” Instead of using animals. On the other hand, there are supporters of animal testing have some good arguments. First, they think that it’d be unethical to induce humans to the same test and release drugs to the publics without knowing the possible side effect of drugs. Another one is there is no choice to animal due to their similarity to human. Some organization argue for the three R’s in animal testing ; Replace, Reduce and Refine. Anyways, animal testing can save many human lives and will make the world a better place.\n",

My frozen heart that is still beating and it’s beating with the blood which isn’t mine but taken from the lives of others. I really want to end this.

      "textContent--->Being freshman Being freshman is more difficult than being high school student. For instance freshman has many activities more than high school student such as Freshy Game, meeting association, etc. So that freshman has to do it together with manage their time to read books or do homeworks. Some freshmen can't handle it that make they have poor grade. Freshman takes less subjects than high school student but every subject is very difficult and also has a lot of homeworks or reports. Many freshman have to go to bed late almost every day for read many books, prepare for next lesson, do the research, etc. So you can see their faces are full of pimples. Apart from their hard study, some of them have problem with adjustment to new friends, separate from old school friends and don't have any new friends yet or not intimate as old school friends. These absolutely make them feel lonely or don't want to go to the university. All in all I think, however, to be freshman is not easy. If you are freshman that mean you are one step to be adult and you should proud of it.\n",

      "textContent--->Thresholds On the other hand, the Thresholds theory sums up the relationship between bilingualism and cognition. This theory is represented by the illustration of a house with three floors. The bottom floor represents the group of individuals whose current in both languages proficiency is below their average age level. This can bring negative outcomes because children won’t be able to function academically, plus negative cognitive effects may occur. The second floor describes the group of individuals with average age level proficiency in one of the languages. This stage of bilingualism allows children to function academically in one of the languages. However, no cognitive advantages may be observed during this stage. Moreover, the third floor portrays the group of “balanced bilinguals”. This group is able to function at the average age level in both languages. Also, cognitive advantages superior than monolingual children may be observed.\n",

      "textContent--->What did I use to look like in the past? and What do I look like presently? REPORT OF OPINION-COLUMNIST                      4th September 2010 What did I use to look like in the past? and What do I look like presently? For different reasons human being nowadays tries answering both questions to itself in order to look for either a better picture or image of itself to cope with a feeling of non-satisfaction and unhappyness that I think human being has always been involved with, especially during the present, in which everyone has to be slim, tall, nice, smart and handsome for a very competitive world not only for being a skillful professional in your career, but looking like very beautiful and handsome and attractive to others. We could likely answer that we used to look like uglier, and less smart and handsome than now, and probably with longer hair, and definitely less intelligent and experienced in life; but of course, we would always like and expect of ourselves to look like more beautiful and  brilliant in any aspect of our lives. It is supposed and it has been part of our lives that evolution works very deep inside of us and as the time goes by, we strongly live many different experiences that help us to be like the way of being we are and look like the appearance we do, throughout the different social events and trends, and we would have ever probably thought to be going through those thoughts  and way of seeing life which is part of the moment, the year and the Century we are in. So the best conclusion we can get on this report about what we look like now and what we had ever wanted to look like if we would have ever been asked for the next future, in the past is that we had better answer, the person should care about many important things other than the appearance we used to have in the past, and the one we have nowadays, because it is just a matter of an overall of events we are living in, and the result (overcome) of an evolution in our lives, and the most important thing is taking into account  “the person”  we are which is supposed to be our wealth, and let´s be authentic  and non-superficial, Shall we?

      "textContent--->Continue studying Korean on Vacations. Today I decided to continue studying Korean. Lately, I have been studying it at all and without knowing in advance I had an interview last Saturday and it seemed like I didn't know anything of Korean, or like I completely forgot how to speak it. The interview was with a Korean Channel or something, I really didn't know because it was our Closing Event at our Korean Institute and I was so focused on correctly performing a Taekwondo dance with my group that day, but then my teacher came and told me to do that interview. I think I was nervous or I didn't understand what the interviewer wanted me to say. I introduced myself, not speaking correctly in some parts, and I noticed it, but they told me it was too long and I only needed to say something like ''I'm studying Korean and I like the Korean culture, I also like to listening to Korean music and practice Taekwondo''. It was really easy but I don't like the Korean music and I don't practice Taekwondo so it was like I was lying and I didn't like that. Avoiding this bad experience I had, I wanna share with you some nice moments I spent with my group at that event and after wards. I'm just waiting for the pictures so I can share them with you.

What does it means? I think that is a kind of rhyme. In spanish we have something similar that we used to select a person. Our rhyme said: \"De tin marín, de don pingüé, cúcara mácara títere fue, yo no fui, fue teté, pégale, pégale que ella fue\". Somebody knows more about this little rhyme?

      "textContent--->ANIME in my LIFE There are many things I like to do, but one particular hobby and sometimes part time job of mine is to draw, I remember drawing since I was four years old, I was a fan of a show called G Force or Gatchaman in Japan, that´s the first anime show I can remember ever watching, then when I was six or seven I´d watch Iron 28 (Tetsujin 28) I loved that show, Then came along Saint Seiya, and every kid would watch that, it was a phenomenon but the actual figurines/toys were very expensive so I only had a few (I was particularly fond of Greek mythology since my grandad used to tell me the stories). Man I was so god damn addicted to Saint Seiya!!!, then a friend of mine was watching a show called Dragon Ball, and I hadn´t payed attention to it because it was the story of a kid and I was already watching epic battles in Saint Seiya, nevertheless Dragon Ball got us all hooked as the kung fu tournaments began to take place in the series and soon enough we all began to forget about ¨EL METEORO DE LA ESTRELLA DE PEGASO¨!!!... sigh now that I look back at saint seiya, it was such a repetitive show haha they´d always use the same rutines and story arch formulas. So yeah, by the time Dragon Ball Z began to air in Mexico it was already 1997, and I was in Junior High, everybody watched the show, like every kid, otaku kid or not we would watch the show, many even recorded it, I remember my TV broke and I couldnt use the one in the living room, and I had to hit it to make it work haha poor tv. So thats when I was drawing all the time, I was one of the kids who were famous for his drawings skills, and we werent that many, maybe five kids in the whole school could copy like I could, at least 5 kids my age... and yes we would only copy... kinda lame I think. A couple years later a ¨drawings¨ rival friend I had, lost my copied drawings I was so proud of (they were many, like 40 drawings) or so he said, and I thought I´m never copying again and ever since I´ve only drawn my own characters, well I guess we all copy to a certain degree, there´s no such thing as originality, after all we are all composite human beings. So well, I kinda became an Otaku in high school, I mean Id watch anime that wasnt necesarily being aired on standard TV like Evangelion and Rurouni Kenshin which became two of my all time favourite shows. At that time I was already writing a lot too and a few friends and I would get toghether to make up stories and characters, it was fun. To be honest I never really got along very well with other otakus, I was more of an artist than a fan, I never actually admired other artists since I always thought I could do what they were doing, but even better do it my own way, I think other otakus saw that as arrogance, but those were my honest feelings and I wasn´t being a prick to anybody... I still feel the same way, it´s like music, I´ve never been able to say, this or that artist is the best I identify myself with him/her the most, i´ve never been able to do that, there´s always something I like and something I don´t. So yeah, here´s another page for my journal, I have also read some mangas, but mostly for research, since manga is not realy popular or mainstream in Mexico. I´m sure its got many mistakes :P I´m throwing a few manga pages I´ve done for the record.\n",

The \"why\" is pretty simple, I've got a new job in illustration fields for an Important advertisementcompany here in my town. Despite they're waiting for me to start working in their office on march 29th, they gave me time to quit my current (and boring) job and rest because they said i'm going to need it, they got an important project and they need an illustrator (among editorial designers) for the job so they called me up. They also asked me to create sketches and potential designs that could be included in the project, needless to say I'm very happy with the job and I'm drawing/sketching like crazy in order to do my best and keep this job. I''ve been pretty busy, going out, watching movies, studying the subject of project to create new artwork. It hasn't been too stressful but I suspect that it will turn stressful very soon once I start working in that place. I'll be sharing some artwork very soon in here.

      "textContent--->South Africa and GM \tThe relationship between ethics and business has been difficult since their beginnings. Thanks to Plato, we can read about heated debates about this subject that took place more than 2.000 years ago. In spite all of this, we can say that there is no clear answer about how much of ethics a business should have. To some, a business is just a commercial endeavor that should try it maximize its profits whit in the legal framework. On the other hand, a business enterprise can be seen as a integral participant of society. Not excluded from the responsibilities that every citizen has. Now days, this concept is called Corporate Social Responsibility. It not only defines the domain of the business responsibilities towards the society, but also pursue an expanded stakeholders concept. A concept that indicates that the stakeholders of a business are not only their owners and customers, but also the whole society where it operates. If we consider a business with in this framework, it becomes much easier to understand the why GM stopped it’s operations in South Africa more than 20 Years ago. \tThe case about GM leaving South Africa cannot be analyzed as a isolated case1. It came after series of strikes, international sanctions and other companies decision to leave the country. This gives us a better idea to understand the reason behind it and later return to the country. Certainly, no company wants to leave a market that they are already established in. Moreover, a manufacturing company like GM, would find particularly difficult to take such a decision. The size of their operations and the time required to recover their investment makes the case for the company to stay. Given this situation, how does GM ends up leaving the country, is an interesting case to analyze the extended stakeholders concept previously talked about. In this case, the stakeholders were not only the african society, but the whole international community. The repudiation that generated the deeply disturbing nature of the apartheid, extended to the business domain as well. Forcing some to leave the country to avoid damage to their reputation, something that would affect negatively their international operations. At that time, GM, along other companies, had to balance their profit seeking nature with their responsibility to the society. However, this decision can be seen also as money-oriented, given the fact that they could lose business in the already desegregated United States. Anyhow, the fact that the society also demand to the corporations to act responsibly, is definitely a positive thing. \tHowever, we cannot forget about the consequences of this decision to the south africans, white and blacks. Even though it can be seen as positive to pressure the government of south africa at that time with this kind of measures, it is undeniable the economic effect that it creates in the country. With this kind of decisions, the most affected are the South Africans. Employment is lost, investment stops and the supply of goods diminishes. Given this situation, to which society should corporations owe their responsibilities? The local or the global stakeholders? Certainly, this can be a very difficult aspect to decide upon, as there are not clear answers. We can see how negative are the prospects for the new local company, Delta Motor Corporation. In fact, the company did not perform as expected, limiting itself to the local market and not exploiting the potentially lucrative exports market.\n",

I usually speak Spanish on my daily basis ('cause it's my native language), though I've been learning English at school since I was 6 years old, since 1st grade, and now I'm on 2nd year of middle school (though here we have elementary school and secondary school, which lasts 5 years, it's not separated into middle & high school, though it's basically the same..) I've always been just 'good' in English, but two years ago I started reading a lot, not books, actually, but fanfictions >w<' it sounds weird, but yeah, I learned a lot from reading, and then I started to learn a lot with music and movies, and now I know a lot more English than the English level at my school (though my english teacher is kinda bitchy and it's kinda hard even for the ones that know a lot of English :/) Yesterday, I wrote a short entry in Japanese. I've been 'learning' (if it can called 'to learn') Japanese, since july 2009, but I'm really lazy, something I actually hate, so I just know a few words, some sentences, and my grammar is really, really poor. I planned attending to Japanese classes, but they seem to expensive for my mom to pay T__T so, I think that I can't go, and I have to study by myself.

Good evening Today, I got up at 9:00 am, I frequently get up at 10:35 but I woke up early because I was thinking all the night about what to want, my objectives, my problems, my family, etc. Sometimes I don't have head for thinking, I'd like relaxing a little one day where I could forget everything. Generally, my dad tries to look me up problems. I think the life is a garbage. in my view my life isn't a fairy tale where I am a prince the days sometimes get me down and \"por lo general\",I'm always alone in a lot of occasions my head thinks about finding an easy solution for everything my problems, I think that you guys will imagine it about what I want to say, moreover, sometimes,I hate that the things don't come out how I want. I don't know if my life sucks or not but what yo know is that my english is terrible :( :( I'm tired of everybody but it doesn't matter. when I was going in the bus for going to my studios, almost the bus crashes with other bus but happily It didn't occur.

      "textContent--->Help, I need somebody.. Help! D: Hello everyone, my name is Felipe but my friends call me \"pipe\", although I'm Chilean/Indonesian, I only speak Spanish. The reason why I singed up is that I need to drastically improve my English skills within the next two weeks (I wish I had paid more attention to it when I was in high school, but at that time I was a very lazy student and honestly, I never thought that I'd ever need it, what an irony!). Yes, I know it may sound like an impossible task, but as they say: \"Hope is the last thing you loose\". So here I am, asking for some help I've been learning English by myself, mostly through Internet and lately I've been reading a book called \"Life with The Taylors\" that I found while I was scrutinizing my father's stuff. The book is kind of old, if I'm not mistaken, it was printed in 1960. The funny thing is that I can only read/write in English but I'm not able to speak it. I don't know how I'm going to take that English oral test :(. By the way, if you need help improving your Spanish, or learning it, you can always count on me. You can find me on facebook, MSN, or just write me an e-mail at this e-mail: address: pipe. gaetan@hotmail. com Anyway, any correction pointed out would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance. -pipe chao chau :3!\n",

Those ones were just the three first entries when I typed \"translator\" at Google. Probably there's a hundred different types of translators on the Internet. Nowadays, I haven't found a really good one yet. What I'm trying to say is that if you don't know a language, no matter how hard you try to find a good translation in one of those online translators for what you want to say, it isn't going to work. Don't trust me? Ok, let's see. For example, the sentence \"Those ones were just the three first entries when I typed \"translator\" at Google.\" Easy, isn't it? I'm going to translate it in Spanish: \"Esas fueron tan solo las primeras tres entradas cuando escribí \"traductor\" en el Google.\" Now, I'm going to translate it with an online translator: \"Esos unos fueron justo el tres primero entradas cuando escribí a máquina a \"traductor\" en Google.\"  Do you see what I mean?

He need alive grasshopper and with the cold weather is not so easy to find. I don´t think this poor chamelon was lost in the field. I think someone let him to go because is not easy to take care exotic animals, they need specials care. We go to take grasshopper with the children and put in a box with plants, so.. we haven´t to go away everyday to feed the chameleon. With this we get two things. We walk with the children and we have the food for the chameleon. I´d like people didn´t buy animals if they can´t be responsable. They must be clean and they have to eat everyday.

I know the movies can change when they are perform in different countries but they are things they can´t change or uhmmmm they can´t understand when is about different cultures or situations. I like cartoons, and I think some ideas are for adult not for children ... for that I laugh when children don´t understand the meaning but they laugh anyway. They are so innocent. I had a very sad feeling because they speak about the destiny of the toys when the children grow up. How sad is when nobody want you because now you have another interest. This made  me to think about the toys I had when I was a child. I haven´t anyone now. Did they feel like the toys in the movie??? I hope no. LOOOOL\n",
      "textContent--->Internet versus television All the things are changing faster and faster nowadays, and one of the most important is the way we communicate with the world and get information, something traditionally done trough the TV. Although the TV is still important, certainly people, and especially the new generations, are moving from the TV to the net as their primary way of communicate with each other, read the news or see their favourites movies or television programmes. I think that this is a real revolution and very positive on the whole. The things that you can do surfing the net are immense and really huge in comparison with the TV. I would say that the Internet represents the real freedom, because it is the only media that is not tightly controlled and subject to the censorship as it is the TV or the radio. In the net you can choose from an enormous selection the paper that you want to read, the field that you want to study, etc, and most importantly: you are who is choosing, and not being chosed as you are with the tv. It is true that the TV has a lot of channels and you can choose and switch from one to another, depending on your political tastes and preferences, but the range is very little actually compared with the Internet. Finally i would highlight the dangers that the Internet is facing at present. For sure the most important is the governs worldwide trying to repress the freedom of the net with more or less credible excuses depending on the country, promulgating laws whose real intention is to censorship the webs that are not agreeing with the so called \"political correctness\". I hope that the freedom of the net will continue for ever, but i am not very optimistic, knowing that Power doesn't like freedom at all.\n",

      "textContent--->About earthquakes Yesterday, there was a temblor in South Spain. There were deaths, that's sad. Recently earthquakes has caused damages worldwide. It all makes me think that the end of our age it's near. Mexico is a country located in a seismic zone. The most devastating earthquake was in 1985 (8.1 Richter), with about 10,000 deads. The Government hid information because they didn't want that people realized the magnitude of the event. The Government also did it because they were the culprits of a lot of deads caused by the bad planning of buildings. This year, I have lived three or four seisms- I can't rememeber how many, my head is full. They were of high magnitude, between 5.5 and 7 in Richter Scale. I am worried, probably there will be a great earthquake in Mexico which will destroy the city (Mexico City). The city is built over a lake system, buildings won't resist.\n",

      "textContent--->My Favorite Movies I always read books or listen to music in my free time. I also spend time walking on the streets of my hometown. A few of my friends like going out to dance. They really like dancing but it's not one of my main hobbies. In fact, I don't like dancing. It's better to say \"I can't dance\" hahaha. Whatever the reason, I rarely dance, so I don't have to spend money on night clubs. What I do like a lot is to see movies on the weekends. When I go to the movies, I usually go alone because my friends and I can never agree on what movie we should see. I recently saw a movie called \"The Hurt Locker\". I think it's the coolest movie I've ever seen about war. I don't know if it is boring, because it doesn't have special effects but it has a great story. It was breathtaking to see how soldiers defuse bombs! The mood and the feeling of the film are impressive, so it looked like real war. Most people love movies like \"Avatar\", which I don't like very much. I hardly ever see movies like this. I remember being told about this film but I didn't pay attention to it. I saw it anyway, but I left in the middle of the film. I'm a little tired so I can't write anymore.\n",

      "textContent--->Third post on Lang-8 Hi, It's poorenglish_ again, and this is my third post on Lang-8. I would like to write about my little experience with language courses. I began with Pimsleur, an audio-course, the mechanic is easy, listen, repeat and say some sentences. Ok, I think this method is good for beginners, you can get an understandable pronunciation, and some basic knowlegde if you want to travel soon to the country. Apart from that I don't see other benefits. Maybe it's because I'm not a patient person and I usually listen English, but I got bored very soon. I finished pimsleur in about sixty days (yes, I don't like to repeat lessons) My next course has been Assimil and I liked it. I read the 146 lessons in the book, you can read sentences (expressions, idioms, jokes) with only a few grammar notes, I listened some lessons when I saw any difficult word. I enjoyed this passive stage like a way to see English sentences with audio. In my next post I will talk about the finally good part of the Assimil method... the active stage\n",

      "textContent--->what i like about him I'ts nor very original, is it? Girl meets boy, boy meets girl. But, hey I'm talikng about me right now, so taht means strange girl meets strange boy in very weird circumstances. Currently, the cold and naked truth Is that I can't no anything. He is in London, I am in my home town. But I dont want to talk about it, I want to talk about why I think it's a good idea to try to know him better, to try to break all my psochologial barriers and to find a reason to be alive outside of myself. The first, and the most important thing is that he is not the kind of man that I can manipulate. Being honest, sometimes I can be a awful and cruel bitch, and I know he won't cede to my dirty emotional blackmail or my not less dirty guilt trip. So, I' m happy cause I think I' ve finally found someone who can see my real face, which includes my dark side, and, at the same time, I am worryed because I am really used to manipulate people's emotions instead of say \"i'm sorry\" when I am wrong, and I think it's gonna be hard to give up with it. Although, i really believe a person like him can make me be a better girl. The second thing I like about him is that he knows about what I am talking about when I talk about pain. His life hasn't been very funny, really. He is able to understand me when I talk about my broken family, my fears and my contradiction, cause he has lived all that. He know what yo feel when you love and hate at the same time, when you are surrounded by people but you feel totally alone. For me, this is important. I dont want a relationship with the happiest person in the world, I just want someone who can understand my fears, my contradictions and my madness. And maybe cure it. The last thing is that I like his turned-up nose and his tattoos. No, I'm serious now, I find him cute. It's strange, because I've passed almost my whole life obsessed with guys who seemed to be Kurt Cobain's brothers: skinny, blondes and with a hippie style. And he is not blonde, he has not long hair, he is not anorexic and he is more a punk than a hippie.\n",

Then she told me she came when she was ten, but I still did not believe her until she started to speak in chinese as proof that she was a foreigner. After a while we stopped seeing each other but I still remember her. Today I was thinking about her, I hope to see her again someday.\n",

I've already answered him in a private message, but I'd want to extend that reply for every lang-8 people. Maybe, somebody will find it as a help. If you have a non-Spanish keyboard, you can write the Spanish characters using the ASCII code. You must keep pressed the 'ALT Gr' key while you type the numerical code. Following are the most used Spanish characters and their corresponding codes: á = ALT + 160 é = ALT + 130 í = ALT + 161 ó = ALT + 162 ú = ALT + 163 ñ = ALT + 164 Ñ = ALT + 165 ü = ALT + 129 Ü = ALT + 154 ¿ = ALT + 168 ¡ = ALT + 173 I hope it would be of great help.

A complete forest preserved in time is something that could transform our vision of that period, and it permits investigators to know what caused the decrease of some of those species. I couldn’t agree more with the paleobotanic that believes we have a big opportunity to know how carbon dioxide affected the 300 million years ago atmosphere.

I honestly believe that this happens all the time, people make racist jokes all the time, but when the jokes or whatever is said is about one's culture it's just like they have offended our national pride. It has been commented in about every single news show I've seen today and I don't think it calls for it. Personally, I found way more offensive the activity in Australia's Big Brother in which they had to throw balloons to the Mexican flag, although this one also had some comments that were totally uncalled for. And to be honest, no one even knew about that Mexican sport car here. Guess it's gonna sell a lot after this. It's also a nice way to have something other than dead people on the news once in a while. Like we say, if the coat fits, wear it. I think those offended fit in the description made in the program...

Eventually, I just saw a whale and it was in a movie, which was utterly disappointing. 2. There have been extra and hidden charges. 3. The captain was unprofessional. He always got up late and was drinking alcohol. 4. I have paid for a fortnight cruise and our ship has finished its journey the tenth day. Hence, I have been stolen five days of vacation. I hope to have news from you as soon as possible apologizing for all this troubles that I have been caused for your service and offering me a logical compensation. Yours sincerely,  Andrés\n",

So I read a lot of things about approximately 10 cities. And among them, I discovered a lot of interesting things about those two.

For this, I usually plan my classes thinking of the main ideas that all students should be able to learn.

Therefore, I plan a variety of activities such as games, music, dance, TPR, journals, pictures, puzzles, drawing, role playing, storytelling, individual work, small or big groups, etc. Another innovative way is the use of up-to-date technology. I constantly use PowerPoint, video and music. I find different internet services very educational. For example, students can demonstrate understanding of a variety of topics through online games, activities and simulations. They can improve their reading or listening skills by using fun websites such as Voki, which allows student to create avatars and use text-to-speech functions. We can also access a verity of authentic material from newsgroups, blogs, websites, etc. Besides, technology facilitates the assessment of students by using video or audio for speaking assessments.\n",

My girlfriend say that he isn't a god writer, but I'm completely desagree with her. If you read any of his books you feel all the scale of emotions that the caracters feel. You can't stop reading, and you finish the books in a few days, even when they are very large. Other aspect that I want to say is the enermous capacity of telling all type of stories, from terror to ordinary tales. If you look for in his bibliography, you can find stories that film director have put into scene: from the beatiful story about the friendship of a group of children in The Body, terror tales as The Shinning, Chrytine, or Carrie, and penitenciary scripts as The Green Mile or Rita Hayworth and Shawsank redemption.

When I was still undecided on how to face this new challenge, I went back to Naha (Okinawa Prefecture's Capital) and assisted to the \"Naha Ozunahiki Hatagashira Gyoretsu Festival\", an event I attend every year since I was a child. There, I encounter myself with a contemporary eisa group, and I can still remember the goosebumps caused by their performance. That is how I found what I was looking for, and the impact of that moment still remains lively in my memory. Without forgetting that emotion, and as Honorific Ambassador of Okinawa I try my best to contribute in promoting Okinawa, from Tokyo to the rest of the Japan, and even further, to the whole world.

I got many laughs, needless to say; it was Deadpool, after all. Deadpool’s Poem First, allow me to dedicate this poem to Bea Arthur. The world won’t be the same without her. Now, enough about Bea, Let’s talk about me. Wade Wilson’s my real name, Being a merc (That’s mercenary for short, kiddies) is my game. I was dying of cancer, So I thought joining Weapon X was my answer. Oh, they cured me alright, But now I’m so ugly, I gotta wear a mask all day and all night! Some people think I’m Spider-Man when they first see me in costume, Or so they like to assume. As if I would sell my marriage with the red hot supermodel to the devil! While I may be crazy, I assure you that in that regard, I’m quite on the level. I’ve made a few friends over the years like Blind Al, Weasel, Bob, and Cable, Who all can’t stand when I put my feet up on the table. I’m also quite the ladies man, too. Syrin, Copy Cat, Death, Typhoid Mary, and Big Bertha are just a few. For those of you wondering just who I yam, I’m a comic book character, that’s what I yam! Oh, and I was in the Wolverine movie, Which clearly wasn’t all that groovy. The minute that they decided to sew up my mouth, Is when that movie went south. But never fear, Ryan Reynolds the actor is here. He claims he wants to do my solo movie just right, So as to not cause a fan boy fight. I and fan boys everywhere swear that if his Green Lantern movie gets in the way, By God, he shall pay! Just how do I know all of this if I’m in a comic book, anyway? Well, boys and girls, I break the fourth wall each and everyday. I’m so popular, I have 3 monthly comic books. You should see how jealous Captain America looks. I recently had my 900th issue, Quick, somebody please pass the tissues. I’ve also been in a few videogames. Marvel Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends 2 are just a few of the names. Well, it’s time for me to go. I gots a whole lotta people to kill and gotta collect me some dough.\n",
      "textContent--->King's Day “Día de reyes”. I think is one of the biggest dates for the Mexican children (although not for the parents). The day has his origins in the bible’s story about the three kings or wise men that gave gifts to the baby Jesus. On January 5th, the children put a shoe outside their bedrooms with a letter, asking for presents (usually toys). They also can send the letter on a balloon; it’s fun to see the trees around those days, because you can see many balloons that get caught by the trees and didn’t make his way to the sky. On the night of January 5th, the three kings leave the presents in the children's house. On the morning of January 6th, the children wake up and find their toys, the streets are empty. All the children are in home playing with their new toys. My favorite part of “Día de Reyes” (maybe because I’m no longer a girl and I don’t receive toys anymore) is the “Rosca de Reyes”. It’s ring-shaped bread. The bread is so delicious; it’s made with anise and orange. On top it has some crystallized fruits. Inside the bread, it’s hidden a little figure of plastic (in the beginning was a porcelain figure) of a boy; it’s supposed to be the kid-Jesus, but we call it ‘mono’ (the boy-doll, its kind of pejorative) or ‘muñequito’ (the little boy-doll). If you are eating your bread and you find something :), you probably are eating the muñequito’s feet. But that’s something to celebrate! Because that means that you’re the godfather of the boy Jesus and you’re going to throw a party on February 2nd, the special food for that day is ‘tamales’.\n",

I want to share this learning method with you because it has been useful for me. It is the well-known strategy called “re-telling”. The idea is simple, you have to write something, it can be something that happened to you in the past or a new you heard on the radio as well as a story your parents used to tell you when you were younger. It is important to say that what you want to say, in this case, has to have a body, I mean, the beginning, the middle and the ending. It is possible to raise this learning strategy in several ways. 1- The first one is the litteral re-telling strategy. Taking this strategy, you should try to repeat a text exactly as it was said. As an example, if your mother told you a tale beginning by: “once upon a time in a far, far away land, there was a magic kingdom…” You should repeat exactly that frase. That kind of approach will help you to memorise sintax rules and intonation  patterns as well as your long term memory. 2- The second one is similar to the previous one, but in this case it is not necessary to say it exactly as told. However it is necessary to keep the order of the narration. It could be called the direct telling strategy. Taking into account the previous phrase as an example, using this approach you can vary the elements used, maintaining the same content: “Somewhen in the past, in  a distance no one imagines, a fantastic realm existed …” This approach will develop your long-term memory as well as your lexical competence which you’ll use to make an interpretation (like a singer) of the story. 3- In the third one you will change the order of the story, telling it litterally or with your own words but maintaining the same content of the story. It will help you to develop your communication abilities as well as your rethorical skills and long-term memory. 4- In the fourth approach, you’ll tell the story in the original or your own order, but modifing some parts of the content. It could be the beginning, the middle or the ending. It will also help you to reinforce your communication abilities as well as your imagination, along with your rethorical skills. 5- In the fifth, and last case, you’ll take some elements from the story and you’ll create a new one from them. The elements you can choose from are:  Vocabulary- Use the vocabulary you didn’t know to practice it building a new story. Characters-  You can use the same characters, but putting them in diffrerent settings with a different plot. Plot-  You can use the same plot, but developing it with different characters. I have seen that some users have used it. As them, I have tried some of the different approaches, with magnificent results. There are several ways to learn. The ideas above are just some of the points you can take into account but you have surely found other points of view… What do you think about this? Have you ever tried it? Was it good for you? Looking forward for your always really appreciated feedback!!\n",

I would like to know if the speech is fine. Here is speech. I want to say thanks to \"the life\" for being today here, in Japan, with Miwa. Thanks to Miwa I realised that with effort, believing in oneself, everything is possible. \"Miwa, the life bring to us special gifts and you are my best gift that I have never received. Our life started in Toronto even when we did not know. I can say that I was waiting for you. Do you remember it? And when we were far away, you always believed in our relationship that today we are together. Miwa, you are a very special person. I am so happy because you are my wife. We know that for being couple we need to respect eachother, to have patience and something very important, being the best friend\". Every one need to know this. Like every couple, sometimes we fight. However, even when she is mad with me, I am Happy for being in Japan with you, Miwa. \"Hi, so desu\" Maybe  somebody is thinking \"Sogoi, Oscar is speaking japanese\". Yeap, I am speaking japanese but this is posible because Hana, Suki, Hiroe, Chana and Mimami. Thank you very much And I want to say a very special thanks. KYOKO thank you very much. Maybe without your help, today I could not be in Japan. Kyoko, you know the reason. And Thank  everyone for come to the Costemia Anniversary, Valentin`s Day and Oscar and Miwa Weddings Party. Maybe almost everyone  knows that I met Miwa dancing salsa in Toronto. And today, one more time, we are going to dance together. And This  is for all you for being  sharing  a this special moment.

      "textContent--->Controversial traditional celebrations in Spain One of the most famous celebrations of Spain is \"Bullfight\". In Spanish it's called \"Corrida de toros\". A man wearing traditional costumes called \"Torero\" fight with a Bull. The Torero has a speacil sword and some spears. He has to hurt the Bull with it, and prevent that the Bull don't him. (it's difficult for the Bull to hit the Torero, because before the celebration somehow inject something to the Bull that makes it feel a little bit sleepy, like a drug) Later, when the Bull is completly bleeding, the Torero kill it. This celebration is done so often, specially during the summer. And most of Spanish people go to see it, and some foreign people, too. Why is this celebration so interesting??? Why is make a Bull suffer and then kill it interesting??? That Bull has no gulty!! Poor Bull !! It's an animal and it has to be respected!! But the Torero and all the people who see it has no respect to it!!! This celebration makes me feel ashmed of being Spanish T. T Now in Cataluña Region (Barcelona is in Cataluña) it's forbidden. And I'm happy about it. But some other Regions still celebrate it. This celebration is really controversial in Spain because there are people (me included) who want to forbid it in the whole country. But in the other hand, there are a lot of people who don't want it to be banished, because It's a Historical Celebration. They say that the Bull doesn't suffer ¬¬ Who the hell believe it!!!! A Bull bleeding doesn't suffer??? That's completely false!! I don't know If this celebration it's also done in other countries, I hope not. What do you thing about this Celebration?? I hate it.\n",

It is said that \"The Kiss\" of Gustave klimt is one of the masterpiece with more merchandise in the history. It was painted in the golden period of the author. The painting is about a kiss between two lovers. The woman is on her knees, and you may think that the man is in the same position. They both are covered by golden clothes. It is important to point out the fact that the woman's hair is red. It looks that Klimt loved women with red hairs, and many of his paintings are filled with them.\n",

However there are others operating systems and this is a fact that many users don’t know. Usually people buys a computer with Windows already installed on it, so they think Windows is the only operating system. That is not true. There are more than one hundred operating systems and every operating system has his advantages and disadvantages. However almost everyone use Windows. I want to present Linux as a better alternative than Windows. It is important to point out that Windows and Linux are different. So you shouldn’t expect to find a button Start, or the same Control Panel with the same options. Usually you would complete all tasks you do on windows in a different way on Linux. They are sometimes similar but never equal. So you should be patient to learn a different way to do things. However you would be satisfied when you accomplish your learning.\n",

You have to pass one or the interview then and exam, and wait someone to call you. I have no problem with psychological interviews, but I have some problems with what is called illegal questions. One of the most common illegal questions I get “what does your family do?” “Where do your brother work?” I didn’t know that it where illegal questions but I have to admit that wanted to say “Why do you care? ¬¬“, now I know that there are illegal questions. Other common illegal question is “How old are you?”, I have no problem telling that I’m 26, but it was annoying when someone look me like telling me “omg you can tell the job because you are 26, you are qualificated for the job but you are 26….”. But the most annoying question I get was “where do you born?”, I found that a racist question then I get a lot of illegal questions, I remember that when the interview finish I wanted to tell the CEO of the company (who interview me) that I won’t work for his company even if he pay me one million of soles”.

      "textContent--->Underachivement/Causes Bilingualism is often signaled as one of the causes of minority children’s academic underachievement. A common belief is that bilinguals have two under developed languages; while monolinguals have one well developed language. However, according to several theories this is not true. Moreover, the Threshold s theory explains that balanced bilingualism may lead to higher levels of cognition, and only when both languages are under developed detrimental effects such as academic failure may occur. In addition, lack of exposure to the majority language has also been attributed as reason for ELL’s under achievement. Consequently, mainstreaming and transitional forms of bilingual education attempt to ensure a fast conversion to the majority language. Yet, this can stand the chance of doing more harm than good. It denies the child’s skills in the home language, the cognitive and academic competence in that language and often it denies the identity and self-respect of the child itself. On the contrary, bilingual education when effective implemented is not the cause of under achievement; rather it is the cure (p. 206)  Furthermore, mismatch between home and school is also one of the factors for bilingual student’s underachievement. For that reason, the alternative view is that, where practicable the school system should be flexible enough to incorporate the home language and the culture. A mismatch between home and school can be positively addressed by strong forms of bilingual education for language minorities (p. 207). Overall, the real causes of underachievement tend to lie in relative social and economic deprivation and exclusion, a school which rejects the home language and culture of the child, and occasionally real learning difficulties (p. 210).\n",

It's a blog I created today to share my resources of Korean with people who are studying Korean as well. But I have a little problem with creating blogs (and forums) and publishing entries on them, because I am not constant, I mean, I delete blogs when I am bored of it or when I feel like they are a waste of time. The blogs I created before were not about Language Learning or Languages itself, they were about Anime (japanese animated series), asiatic culture in general, and I deleted all of them. I also thought on creating blogs about what I like such as Vegetarian Cooking and Korean Music, but I didn't create any of them. Now I am worried that I may also feel like that and delet this new blog. Because it can be a waste of time then but at the same time it can be very helpful, for me because I can review all I have learned and for people who are looking for some resources of this language.

Its mission is to promote the conquest of the city from ACROSS, but his personal desire is to win the affection and confidence of Ilpalazzo. Despite being the oldest official, she is often out of context Hyatt: Woman hired as a second agent for Ilpalazzo. Very wise and fragile, has a habit of dying and reviving both a fast and impossible. Despite this limitation, it becomes the agent Ilpalazzo favorite, but Hyatt is shown unaware of his condition, does not give much help to Excel for his disease and the link between leader and follower. In the series of FL CL is one of the most interesting women in anime Haruko Haruhara (ハルハラ・ハル子), Haruhara Haruko Voiced by: Mayumi Shintani (Japanese) Mabase's newest resident, an extraterrestrial investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. She becomes the Nandaba household maid while working to find Atomsk, the most powerful space pirate in the galaxy. She uses her bass guitar to create an N. O. portal in Naota's head, through which various objects periodically appear, including Medical Mechanica robots and Naota's guitar, among others. Amarao states in episode 4 and episode 6 that Haruko's real name is \"Raharu Haruha\" (ハルハ・ラハル, Haruha Raharu. History of Excel Saga (エクセル・サーガ,) Ekuseru Sāga Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world. The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and officers Excel and Hyatt. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who is also their emergency food supply, and are later joined by Elgala, another Across officer. Living in the same apartment building are three friends Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, along with co-worker Matsuya, and later Ropponmatsu, who work for the Department of City Security under Dr Kabapu. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans. History of FLCL (フリクリ) Furi Kuri FLCL revolves around Naota. His life is interrupted by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, who bursts on the scene by running Naota over with her Vespa scooter, then giving him CPR and hitting him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar. Later, Naota is shocked to find Haruko working in his house as a live-in maid. Since then, Giant Robots from Medical Mechanica have been coming out of Naota's head and cause more problems for Naota and Haruko. Haruko is using Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk, which puts her at odds with Medical Mechanica, the monolithic industrial corporation. At the same time, Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. The combination of circumstances gets Naota involved in a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.

I don't remember the author's name, I just remember that I read this tale when I was 8 years old. I was in the primary. It's a memory of my childhood. Below I wrote the story's first part. Soon, I'll write the second one. PITA DISCOVERS A NEW WORD One morning, Tomas and Anita came into the Pita's kitchen and they said to her good morning, but Pita didn't answer. She just smiled  with dreamy expression. \"Excuse me for not responding your greeting; I'm thinking about the thing I discovered right now\" Pita said. \"What have you discovered?\" \"A new word! A marvelous word!\" \"What kind of word?\" Tomas inquired with some distrust. \"A wonderful word. One of the best I've heard in my life.\" \"Come on, say it to us, Pita\" the children said. \"Palitroche!\" Pita said triumphantly. \"Palitroche? What's its meaning? \"I wish I know it!\" \"If you don't know what it means, it is useless\" Anita said. \"That worries me\" Pita answered, bitting her right hand thumb. \"Who say what words mean?\" Tomas asked. \"I think that some old masters did a meeting\" Pita said.\"They invented some words and later they said: this word means it... , but no one never thought a word as beautiful as palitroche. What luck that I found it! I bet you everything you want that I'll discover what it means! Maybe it can be used with the noise we make when walking on the mud. Let's listen to how it sounds: When Anita is walking on the mud a wonderful palitroche can be heard... No, it doesn't sounds good. That isn't it. Maybe it's something which can be bought in stores. Let's find out it!\" \"And let's see if we can\" Tomas added. Pita went to seek her purse and filled it with coins. \"Palitroche sounds like a thing too expensive. Probably this money is enough. Once agreed, they three went out the house.\n",

The main character is starred by Will Smith. //////////////////////////////////////////// The movie starts in New York, 2009. The scientist have discovered the total cure of cancer. Or that's what they thought. Later this cure become a terrible virus, an epidemic. 99% of the population became infected, and most of them died. Infected people who didn't die, became terrible beasts. They acted like rabies, and atacted everyone non infected. But that's not all, the virus also infected the animals. Then the movie moves to year 2012. Robert Neville (Scientist) is a survivor, he's immune. He's in New York City completely alone, just with his dog Sam. During the sunlight he goes to the DVD store, looks for food... like a normal life. But when the night comes, he stays at house, with every window locked. It's the time to the \"others\", infected people; because they can't stand the sunlight. He will not leave the City until he find a cure of this Virus. ///////////////////////////////////////////// I like this film. It's interesting. Can you imagine in the same situation as him?? I mean, what will you do If you became a only survivor of a plague? No people, no noise, nothing. Nodoby to talk with. Well, you can talk with the dog ^^U.

I've been using the language for several years but I still feel that sometimes I don't know if I am writing just as a translator from my native language (Spanish) or if I am really communicating in good English. Sometimes when I post something online there are people that notice that am not a native English speaker. Why is that?

Anyway, I hope that practicing constantly will eventually make me have abetter understanding of well written English. Thanks in advance for any help and improvement advice!\n",

      "textContent--->Haiti earthquake  Hum... This is tomorrow's homework, please, could you help me with some mistakes? My final examen is in two days, I'm really nervous Haiti earthquake  Haiti last earthquake was on January 12th, 2010, at 04:53 pm; its epicenter was near Léogâne, approximately 25 km east of Port-Au-Prince. Haiti has been a very poor country that is located in a hug vulnerable place in Central America, between Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. This country has a history of earthquakes, hurricanes and cyclones, and many fights because they were a monarchy after a French colony. Most of the houses were very weak, so they went destroyed. They neither have an enough strong government to confront the terrible disaster. Many buildings collapsed, like the hospital, the harbor and the trade centers, so did the telephonic lines, roads and most of the structures. There are thousands of casualties, missing people, and even if many countries are sending help, and numerous people around the world are organizing campaigns, the disaster would claim between 100,000 to 200,000 lives. The Haitian authorities confirmed that they had buried 150,000 people twelve days after the earthquake. Public figures died, like the Archbishop of Haiti, Haitian blue helmets lieder and musicians. In my opinion, I think it is a very pitiful event, because Haiti was a broke country whose economy has never been good, and this disaster just difficult the situation. Now, the country has to start again, organize a new government, heal people and restructure the city, with all the help, I hope for the best, because they all need a new opportunity. However, the international aid makes us understand that when we help each other, especially in times of need and when the nature is not as peaceful as usually, we can build a better world.\n",

I chose the british civilization, because it has good cavalry to combat other civilizations. Since the start of the game, I had fifteen minutes to take territories, build and prepare an army to defend myself. But, I'm not faster, so in the minute fifteen, I had three territories and buildings, but not an army. The other players were prepared for a war, so I had to build lots of walls in the frontiers, towers, and fortresses. I signed agreements with the closest players, because I don't wanted a war. However, the most distant players declared the war to me. Fortunately, those players were too far to attack me, however they send their ships to attack my ports, my reaction was faster, so I sent my frigates to defend the coastline. That was my first victory, but only would be the beginning...\n",

First of all, I am to be blamed for not attending much often due to whatever reasons. However I do believe that all the members should never give up learning even without presence at the scene. So, I would like to share with you the following three comments: English learning is a self-activated process which is tough but full of surprise and happiness, I do hope that everyone could find joyness in the process of learning and make big progress. English corner activites is a platform which is not easy to be established, so I do hope that it will be always there even only several participants involved each time. It is a magic thing for all of us to meet regularly and share in another language and make friends. Nansha project is now going smoothly, so I can expect more people who are fond of and good at English will find more chances to get involved. If anyone has the interest in working as interpreter, please don't quit learning but try hard to make yourself ready for future potential opportunities. Best Regards, Shirley\n",

      "textContent--->Which do you prefer eat outside or eat at home? Toefl writing Q. Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other peopole prefer to preaper and eat food at home. Which do you prefre? Use specifice reasons and examples to support your answer. Some people choose to eat outside while others choose to eat at home. I prefer to eat at restaurants for the following reasons. The major benefit of choosing to eat outside is that we can save time. As the old saying goes, “Time is money.”  If we eat outside, we do save our time to go to supermarket or traditional market to choose the food ingredients for cooking a meal. Moreover, we can eat at anytime just as we want. Thus, we will not be constrained by time. We can arrange our schedule more flexibly. In other words, eating outside is “saving our money”. Apart from saving time, we can have a variety of choices on food. We like diversification. If we eat similar kind of food everyday, we will feel bored soon. Therefore, we eat outside so that we can change our choices according to our emotional status. In addition, eating outside can make us understand different cultures of regions. For instance, as the main food of Asian countries is rice whereas the main food of Western countries is wheat. If we don’t understand the reason, we can inquire the owners of those restaurants. Hence, we can learn more through eating outside. Finally, we can interact with people more through eating outside. For students, they can ascend their friendship through eating outside. For businessmen, they can choose restaurants according the preference and character tics of the customers. They usually can hammer a deal through eating outside. Therefore, if we can become more successfully through eating outside. It is true that there are some advantages to eat at home. However, as a college students, my home is far from campus. Therefore, it is more convenient for me eating outside rather than eating at home. So I prefer to eat at outside. (Word count: 307 words)\n",
      "textContent--->My dream boy David (By AndyWong) Hi everybody, this is one of my writing assignment. I just want to share with all of you and hope you can correct my work. (Written by Andy Wong from Hong Kong, China.) Dear diary, Yesterday, my dream boy David asked me. \"Amy, would you like to go to the cinema with me on Saturday? \" \"What? Shut up! Am I hearing the truth? \" I thought. I was shocked! I consented his invitation nervously and unnaturally. It isn't believed to be the truth! Do you know what I feel? After school, I went to a Fashion shop and also salon. Because this was the first time I dated my dream boy David, I must give him a good first impression. My hair became flamboyant after I had had my hair cut. I also bought fashionable clothes and a pair of boots. Last night, I couldn't help thinking what would happen tomorrow. I even couldn't sleep! Today, I woke up early. I spent lots of time setting my flamboyant hair and wearing my new clothes. Everything was perfect. I then left home with my promise to my Mum. Not to come home late. I arrived at the cinema fifteen minutes earlier. Ten minutes left, five minutes left... The more the time near, the faster my heart pounded. \"Will he like my look today?\" I asked myself. Suddenly, \"Hey! Amy! How are you?\" It was David! My heart was pounding more quickly. \"What? Who is the girl standing next to David? Is she Tammy? She is really pretty and cool today!\" Tammy then hugged David. \"What is Tammy doing with my dream boy? Oh my goodness! Is she David's girlfriend? Why didn't David tell me?\" I thought without saying anything. My heart was really sour. Tammy then recognized me. She shouted in astonishment \"Wow! Amy? What's wrong with your silly baby clothes and your crap hair? Are you sick?\" I could feel that David also couldn't help laughing at me. Everyone in the cinema could hear Tammy's speech. Many of them were looking at me. Some of them were even pointing at me. At that time, I could feel that my face was burning hotter and hotter. My tear was dropping without my control and I started crying. \"I was not expected to be laughed. David is supposed to be with me, isn't it?\" I kept running out of the cinema and kept asking myself. Ultimately, I went to the stairs. I seat there and cried. No one was interested in caring about me. At last, I stood up and rubbed my eyes. I calmed down and went home. Yes! Maybe I'm not attractive enough. Maybe I should forget about David. It was almost ten o'clock when I was back. Alas, maybe it was just my wishful thinking. I should try to forget about it, shouldn't I? But right now, I am just wondering what will happen on Monday when I get into my classroom. Alas! Will David and Tammy tell my classmate and my friends my silly behavior? Will they think that I'm ridiculous? I just can't imagine that everyone is laughing at me and I am isolated. Oh! What should I do now? Should I pretend that I am sick on Monday so that I do can stay at home instead of meeting them? So confused! Can anyone help me?

      "textContent--->Would you help me correct the following writing? P. S It is a letter to persuade parents not to stop students' physical edcation. Feel free to make corrections and give comments. Dear parents, On behalf of the Student Union,I am writing in response to many parents' request for stopping offering PE lessons to S5-S7 students. However,sport will bring more advantages than disadvantages,and moreover benefit to both the students and the society. Obviously,Sport can teach students big life lessons. There are always failure and success in the competitions. we can learn from failure gradully and will not easily give up. Persistency is one of the essence to be successful in both academic work and sports development. Also,teamspirit can be developed through sport. Being cooperative with others is always important no matter in school or in work. we can be educated to accommodate ourselves in order to achieve a common goal with the teammates. Those life skills cannot be fully acquired in a single activity except in sport. Secondly,sport can prevent students from indulging bad habits. Nowadays,drug abuse is common among students. Those who take drugs usually don not have any talents and interests,so they use drugs to relieve their pressure. But once students cultivate their interests in sport ,their targets will be clear and they know how to cope with pressure. sport is a healthy way to help us relax ourselves. Thirdly,sport can help ease the welfare burden of the gorvernment. Having regular exercises can keep us healthy. If everone is healthy,the medical welfare provided by the government can be reduced. The excess resources could use on education. Morever, a healthy labour force would also have  higher productivity,thus,the economy can have faster growth. In short,sport can benefit the society. It is understandable that parents often have concerns that students may get distracted from studying. However,sport may help students' studying to a certain extent. Especially for senior students,the need to have a healthy body in order to cope with heavy workload. Doing sport is one of the ways to maintain health. Moreover, senior students have to sit for public examination very soon. They may feel anxious. Recently, cases of students suicide are increasing,The students involved do not know how to deal with their anxiety. Some of them feel upset about their results. The common cause is that they feel desperate. Sport can probably cheer them up. Parents usually put students' benefit on the top of the list. BY considering the benefits of students and the society. Stopping offering PE lessons would not be a good idea. We sincerely hope that parents can have serious consideration of the proposal again.\n",

      "textContent--->Adults Only This is my first English entry in Lang-8 and it maybe the last one . Normally ,I would like to write down my essay in Japanese.. This is an exception ,I think. The first language came to my mind is English . And I couldn't find one word of this topic in Japanese. So I wrote down this entry in English , just following my heart.. Or maybe I’m so shy that I can’t write it in Japanese or I don't want to . Anyway, it’s okay , I think . I have to warn you that what I talk today is something about sex . If you feel sick about this topic, you had better go now . Thanks for reading. If you insist on reading this entry and you’re under 18 years-old ,please read it with an adult , thanks. Last night I waked up at the midnight cause I felt hungry. I put on my coat and went downstairs to find something to eat. When I passed by my parents’ room,a thought came to my mind. I should ask my mum directly . Mum , I’m so hungry now, anything to eat? I didn't say it out . cause I heard some voice that indicated that they were having sex at the moment.. So I kept silent and not to aloud them, cause it’s impolite to disturb them. Without any thought , I went directly to the kitchen then opened the fridge to find something to eat.. Luckily ,there’s some bread left. After eating the bread, I felt a little full and went back to my bed to sleep. As I was not hungry anymore and really sleepy at that time, I fell into sleep soon. Today is Saturday ,I don't have to go out but I got up as usual. Mum was preparing our breakfast at that time while singing her favourite song. Yan: mum , you’re so happy today, can you share it with me? Mum: humm… we had sex last night. It’s more than two years since we did it last time.. While listening to what mum’s saying ,I thought of one scene from one J-Drama. A couple were having sex at the midnight inside their bedroom. Their children stand outside and had a conversation like that: Brother in law: what are you doing here? Do you have some mental problem? Sister: They are happy, aren’t they. I wish mum could be happy all the time. I felt the girl’s love to her mother at that time. To be honest , I don't know the true meaning of sex. But a couple’s life without sex ,it’s not a good thing, IMO. Thanks for finishing reading.\n",

      "textContent--->Oh no, summer! “Shit! Gecko!” I shouted when I was back to house last week. It was lying on my desk, doing nothing maybe. I fetch a besom and swept it down to the floor. It was smart, because it hid to the back of my computer. I just stared at the exit, looking for opportunity to kill it. In fact, I was more terrified than it, cause I think if touched by it, I will feel like dying. At last, it came out, and swept away by me. I had thought it was the end of the war, but I saw another one last night. Gecko is not the most annoying creature in summer, but mosquito. My English teacher told me the most uncomfortable thing in China is mosquito, which is hardly could be found in Britain. Even if I made several defensive lines, I can find several new mosquito bites on my skin. If the gecko promises me to eliminate every mosquito at sight, I will make a house for its whole family. Heat also make my computer work slower, which makes me embarrassed when I play computer games online, say Company of Heroes. Now many players just kick me off when they see my computer performance too bad. This is situation that will not occur in winter. Well, maybe I should be more optimistic. After all, summer just lasts six months in Guangzhou, not a whole year. Thank God, I am not living in tropical area.\n",
      "textContent--->Emergency experience Today, i went to the emergency, because my stomach ache again, emergengy was very busy, so every patient have to wait a long time to see doctor, i remember i arrived at emergency at 2 pm, then i lay on the bed, there was a  big clock in front of me on the wall, so i can see what time is it, then after one and half hour, doctor came to see me and gave me some checked, then he said i have to do some lab test, so the nurse came to drawing my blood, and i think the nurse is unexperience, she started to inject my left hand, and i feel very pain, then she said she can't get my blood out, so i suggest her to go to my right hand, finally, she succeed. Then the nurse told me i have to wait for the result, it took about an hour, so i just keep waiting and watch the clock again. Then, the bed next to me have a new patient come in, he told to the nurse he cough a lot and he is getting fever and feel exhausted, sometimes can't not breath easily, then the nurse told him wait for the doctor, and then after thirty minutes, the man started yelling, he shouted why i wait a long time and i am very painful right now, but still have no doctor come to see me, then a nurse came to talk to him, don't yell, many patient here they have to wait a doctor, because today doctor is very busy, so you have to wait, then the man started crying, and he said i think i am going to die, i don't want to see the doctor, let me die, i want to leave here . After that nurses and his wife came to stop him, and told him claim down. Then everything as usual again and the man keep sighing, every patient have a curtain to seperate each other, so i can't see the man face, but when i heard he yell ,i think it was very funny, i feel boring to lay on the bed, then the man make me happy, but also i think he is very poor, but this's the emergengy rule. If you are not going to die, they wouldn't take care about you. So yell or shout at emergency are useless!!!\n",

      "textContent--->Should Children's TV Time be limited? Nowadays, almost every family has one (or more than one, probably), television. Needless to say, TV now becomes an integral part of our life. However, when it comes to children, who are expected to do well at school, should parents limit the hours that they spend on watching TV? Basically, my answer is yes.(54) First and foremost, young as they are, children are undergoing a special period which is lack of self control. If parents fail to educate them properly and leave them alone to abandon themselves in watching TV, they will probably become one of those lacking self controls. They might not be able to arrange their time appropriately and have trouble in allotting their studying time in different subjects. They might fail to control themselves when they are exposed to some kinds of allures, like smoking, alcohol, or even drugs, which can lead to very serious consequences. Furthermore, watching TV can damage our health. With eyes glued to the screen, watching their favorite cartoons, children can end up with poor eyesight. Without necessary exercises and always sitting still in sofa, accompanied by chips, it is possible that children exercise too little and become obesity. In addition, watching TV can also, to some extent, affect the relationship between patients and children adversely. It is very likely for them to quarrel with each other about what programs should be watched. And even if they agree on watching the same program, glancing at the screen silently, which is often the case, actually deprives their opportunity to communicate with each other. Admittedly, watching TV do have some advantages. For instance, some educational program can teach children in an interesting way, even drama can provide them with some topics to discuss with their friends. However, it's disputable that watching TV excessively will do more harm than good for them. Consequently, for their own sake, children's time on watching TV should be limited.\n",

The thing that I always face is that I know what a word mean, but it is difficult for me to use them when I write my passage. I really don't know the reason behind. I have memorized lots of vocaburaries, but the diction that i used are still very limited. While I am composing my writing, I can't think of any other words to help me explaining further. Also, I always find my writings are so childish. It gives me a feeling that these passages are written by a little girl, but now I am 21 years old already. If anyone helped me to correct my passage, I hope that you can give some suggestions to me, in order I can change my style of writing. Thankyou so much~~\n",

      "textContent--->advertisements waste money and time of companies because consumers know what they want to buy. More and more advertisements appear in our daily lives in different forms, like television, newspaper, even internet, etc.. I am often disturbed by various advertisements when I am watching NBA games so that I can’t help hoping to eradicate all advertisements from TV programs. However, this does not mean that I advocate the above statement. Just the opposite, I admit the importance of advertisements play in our daily life. Most of them don’t waste of money but benefits our daily lives, and at the same time help to improve the performance of business which made these advertisements. In daily lives, we do know what we want to buy but in most time we do not know which to buy. Advertisements help us make buying choice and save shopping time. The rapid development of economies brings us so many goods that we often become lost in thousands of similar products with different brands. Sometimes, even products from the same manufacturer might have more detailed types with different characteristics and fit for different kinds of groups. One obvious example is the cosmetic. There are six different types of Nevia Face Care for men, and simply through reading the introduction book embedded in the package, one often can’t know about their specific utilities and hard to make a choice, not to mention whether the customers have enough time to read the book. Television advertisements, which contain specific introduction to products, price information and the ways how we could purchase, reduce the time we may spend on researching and help us chose the most suitable ones. Therefore, advertisements are not waste but do help to our lives. From the perspective of the manufacturers, advertisements not only help them sell more products but also can accumulate the reputation and elevate the brand value for one product or one company. The rapid economic development also brings intense competition among companies. In order to sell more products, company must take measures to let more customers to know about their products and then choose to purchase products. Many survey data researches have demonstrated the positive relationship between the increase rate of sales and the expenditures on ads of one company. In modern market, no company must find the potential customers through various measures, including ads, or the failure will not be avoided. On the other hand, more and more companies begin to realize that they are not only to sell the products but to found an organization with some intrinsic value, which will in turn help to improve the company’s performance in market. Nokia is the famous cell-phone producer form Finland. It not only promotes the specific products in ads, like the N series, but also continuously stress the companies basic belief “Connecting People”. Consequently, we are attracted to buy its products, at the same time we could have in common with its values. Of course, there are some fraudulent ads that delude the customers into sending in money and damage the reputation of the company. Too much ads do harm to our normal lives. But, these are other questions and will not deny the value of ads. A good advertisement is beneficial to both the customers and the company.\n",

      "textContent--->Rickshaws Development? Review of the development of the car, I found that it is in Arts and Craft Movement period (1875 -1915) Rickshaws are a mode of: a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two persons. The word rickshaw came from Asia where they were mainly used as means of transportation for the social elite. However, in more recent times rickshaws have been outlawed in many countries in Asia due to numerous accidents. Nevertheless, what are the things develop to “Rickshaws”??? Arriving to the data statistic, we can extrapolate that the most possibility thing progress to rickshaws would be “Bicycle”. To modify the weakness of the bicycle, rickshaws have been modifying achieve to carry passenger and more than 1 people. This improvement is a great design which can help descendant a lot and inspire them an initial idea to study the vehicle. Runner pulled rickshaws has mainly been replaced in Asia by bicycle rickshaws. They are also common in Western cities like New York City. In London they are known as pedicabs, and in San Diego they are called bike taxis. The term \"rickshaw\" is today commonly used for those vehicles as well, but this article deals exclusively with runner-pulled rickshaws. The word \"rickshaw\" originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha which literally means \"human-powered vehicle” By improving different drawback of Human power transport – Rickshaws, some countries was elaborating it to mechanization. An auto rickshaw is a motor vehicle and a mode of transport in South and East Asia, for private use and as a vehicle for hire. It is a motorized version of the traditional rickshaw or velotaxi, a small three-wheeled cart operated by a single individual, and is related to the cabin cycle. An auto rickshaw is generally characterized by a sheet-metal body or open frame resting on three wheels, with handle bars like a motorcycle, a canvas roof with drop-down sides, a small cabin in the front of the vehicle for the driver (sometimes called an auto-wallah), and seating space for up to three passengers in the rear. They are generally fitted with an air-cooled scooter version of a two-stroke engine, with handlebar controls instead of a steering wheel. Auto rickshaws are light duty vehicles. How can Rickshaws popular in Hong Kong? -Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1874. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men—about four as of 2002—still ply their trade, mainly for tourists.\n",

It is said that this Exposition is the first registered World Exposition hold in a developing country. I feel proud as a Chinese. The theme of this Expo is \"Better City, Better Life.\" It is also the first time that \"city\" as the theme of the Expo. It will be a great event to explore the full potential of urban life in the 21st century and a significant period in urban evolution For its 184 days, participants will display urban civilization to the full extent, exchange their experiences of urban development and explore new approaches to human habitat, lifestyle and working conditions in the new century. They will learn how to create an eco-friendly society and maintain the sustainable development of human beings. In addition, the Expo 2010 in Shanghai China will offer a wonderful opportunity for cross-culture dialogues. The purpose of Expo, in my opinion is provide an international exhibition platform for countries to participate widely in the theme , and get contact and exchanges. World Expo is a record about the wisdom of civilization, and the vision of the future. If I have lots of time, I would like to do and have a see the EXPO in Shanghai. It’s really significant not only for China and Chinese, but also for the world.\n",

However, today my English teacher told us that we had to stay after school for doing more and more exercises. So, you could imagine that how busy we would. We must study until 6:00pm, or maybe longer. To be honest, although I like studing English, I don't think this move can work. On the whole day, we are all exercising on different subjects. And you can understand it in ease, if you do too many similar works, just continue training and training, you will be very tried and you can't work up the enthusiasm. For these reasons, I think this action will just maltreat us and it can't make any help for our study. It will never work.\n",

      "textContent--->Newspaper cutting(1) Q1. Do you think convenience stores should give customers free plastic bags when the 50-cent plastic bag levy comes into force on 7th July? (BG INFO: Hongkong is going to have 50-cent plastic bag levy come into force on 7th July. 50c HKD= 0.07 USD) I think the convenience stores should not give customers free plastic bags. As we all know, the pollution in Hong Kong is very serious. One of the pollution is solid waste pollution. Our waste ends up in garbage dumps that takes up and destroys more and more land every day. First of all, when we go to convenience shop and supermarkets, we ought to bring our own bag. Our landfills are getting fuller and fuller. Most plastic bags are not biodegradable, and therefore we should bring our own bag. Also, those convenience shops are considering giving out free paper bags. It goes without saying that production of paper bags will result in deforestation and our planet is having fewer and fewer trees. Deciding to use paper bags instead of plastic bags is not a wise move. Besides, some big cities in the Mainland China, like Shenzhen, have started to implement plastic bag levy. Most consumers are willing to pay the levy, and some even bring their own bag. The environmental sense in China is gradually increasing. All in all, I think the convenience stores should not give customers free plastic bags because of our environment. Q2. What is your opinion on the new medium-of-instruction policy? (MOI=Medium of instruction/CMI=Chinese as [the language of] Medium of Instruction) There are many comments saying that the new MOI policy is pleasing parents who treat Chinese-medium teaching inferior and desire more English teaching at school. I support the new medium-of-instruction policy. There are several reasons: I think nowadays the standard of English of Hong Kong students is far too low. Compared to other ESL countries, most Hong Kong students do not have a high standard of English and indirectly decreasing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. Since 1980s, the government started encouraging secondary schools using Cantonese as the MOI, but the effect is not so obvious. In 1999, the government gave instructions of MOI, resulting in an increase of CMI schools from 12% to 75%. In fact, the standard of English of CMI schools is not satisfactory. In 2005, 78% of candidates participated in English (Syllabus A) examination and failed in HKALE. On the other hand, for CMI students, there are some great improvements in some subjects such as Mathematics, Geography, History, Economics and so on. One cannot deny that using Cantonese as MOI will help students understand the lesson more easily. In conclusion, I think the new medium-of-instruction policy is the most suitable way for both EMI and CMI students.\n",

      "textContent--->Saving Money Is The Best  Policy Nowadays, a recent survey show that 67 percent of students think that saving money is a good habit. However, some people believe that using tomorrow's money today is better. But I don't see eye to eye with them and I insist that saving money is preferable to overspending. I have two reasons to support my views. First of all, if you put aside money, you won't feel desperate in case of some accidents. For example, when one of your family members catches a serious disease,we can save he/she by affording a timely cure. In addition, saving money for tomorrow won't keep us worried about the bills. Many people buy many more than they can afford, and they often feel quite pressed to pay back the payment of the credit card. From the foregoing, we can safely draw a conclusion that saving money for tomorrow is beneficial, as a proverb goes, be prepared and you won't be sorry.\n",

      "textContent--->I'm okay I was sick couple of days ago. I didn't go to school on Thursday morning. But I did return to school at the afternoon because of the singing contest. Thank God we did quite good and have won the competiton. Oh right it was a trio so it's \"we\" ;p Anyway thank for the people who cared about my health;]! So here is a funny thing that I want to share. On thursday night I went out because I had class. And i was in a hurry, so I didn't put on enough clothes[AGAIN]. It was so cold. It was about 10*C. Then when I walked back home at around 10pm, it was quite windy. And I was totally freezing and shaking. But the most stupid thing was... I stood there for almost a minute since I really couldn't move.... Ok fortunately there weren't many people on the street.. Just a few... so....-_____- Super embarrasing-_-!!!! Christmas is coming! How will you guys celebrate it? Hope you enjoy the holiday;]! See you!\n",

      "textContent--->Gold vending machine I start to learn English from BBC Learning Englsih website, but when I try to listen the sound clisp, I couldn't hear out all of them, can anyone help me see did I hear worng? The following was what I heard from the website. http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/general/sixminute/2009/07/090702_6min_vending.shtml Dima: Hello and welcome to this edition of 6 Minute English with me Dima Kostenko. Kate: and me, Kate Colin. Dima: Kate will be our language guide for today. Today we'll hear a fascinating report about a new vending machine that's unlike any other. But first, Kate, how would descript what a vending machine is? Kate: Well, a vending machine is a machine that you can buy things from most oftener things you can buy to eat on the go such as crisps, choloates, sandwiches and I've actually seen some vending machines sell books in airport. Dima: That's reall interesting, that's something isn't it. Kate: Yeah, I know, I was really suprised when I saw it. It's a very good idea, if you're in a rush and you're running to catach a plane. Dima: Absolutely yes. Kate: Now you pay for these items by inserting a coin through a slot, so these machines are also known sometime as a slot machine. Dima: That's not be quite colloquial though. Kate: Exactly, slot machine can also be known any kind of machines that you put money into, it doesn't have to just be vending machine. Dima: Right! Kate: They can also be known as a dispenser because they dispense, they give us something to the end of the transaction. Dima: Well, Kate, if you're only using vending machines to buy things like chocolate bars or books, you're in for a suprise. As Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's correspondent in Berlin has discovered a German company is planning to install some very different dispensers at stations, airports and shopping centers. Would you like to hear more? Kate: Well, hearing all these phrases from you 'very different' and 'unlike any other' I must say I am a bit intrigued. Dima: You won't be intrigied for too much longer because in a moment we'll hear from Steve Rosenberg to find out what those machine will be selling. I'll say just one thing, it's something really valuable. Kate: OK, let's listen. And as you're listening try to find out what it is they are selling. Also listen out for these words and phrases. 'On the go goodies' meaning small things that we buy and consume without stopping like chocolate bars, crisps and other snacks for example. And 'precious' which means very expensive and valuable. Dima: Here's Steve Rosenberg. Steve: I'm standing next to a vending machine at a Berlin railway station. It offers a typical selection of on the go goodies. There are fizzy drinks and crisps, chewing gum. But very soon, machines like this one could be selling something far more precious than a packet of peanuts. As well as chocolate bars you'll be able to buy gold bars. Dima: So, Kate, what is it that the new vending machine will be selling. Kate: Well, Steve says it isn't going to be on the go goodies. Not chewing gum, not packets of peanuts. It will be the precious metal gold. Well, sounds interesting. But I'm not quite sure I understand, why would anyone want to buy a gold bar from a slot machine? Dima: Well, apparently, with the global financial crisis more and more people decide that they can no longer rely upon stocks and shares the way they used to. Kate: 'Stocks and shares' that's a useful expression, often heard among business people. It means part of the ownership of a company which people can buy as an investment. Dima: Indeed they can. But in reality many start turning to other types of investment which they consider safer, like buying precious metals. And with this new slot machine, buying gold simply can't be easier. The price will be adjusted daily, and in the next part Steve Rosenberg quotes some prices at current rates. And here comes your challenge for this week. Which currency unit is mentioned? Euro, dollar or pound? Kate, which of these three currencies would you expect to hear in a report about gold, recorded in Germany by a reporter of a British broadcaster? Kate: Oh, that's a tricky one and I think I would have to say euro because that's the currency used in Germany. Dima: We'll check your guess later. But first, what's your language point for the second part of the report Kate? Kate: It's the expression 'to keep a close eye on' meaning to watch closely. Steve says 'built-in cameras will be keeping an especially close eye on all the customers' so his word of warning is, watch out how you behave when you use them. Steve: The machine will dispense a gram of gold for about 40 dollars and a 10 gram bar for just under 350 dollars. But one word of warning. If you put in your money and nothing comes out, don't start banging your fist on this treasure chest, built-in cameras will be keeping an especially close eye on all the customers. Dima: That was our correspondent Steve Rosenberg at a railway station in Berlin. Now, before we talk about the answer to this week's question, do you mind going through some of today's vocabulary again Kate? Kate: Not at all. We began by talking about vending machines, that is machines from which small items such as packaged food or drinks can be bought by inserting money. Because cash is inserted through a slot, they are also known colloquially as slot machines. And another synonym is dispensers. We then mentioned the phrase on the go goodies meaning small things that we buy and consume without stopping, like chocolate bars, crisps and other snacks, for example. And then, the word precious, which means very expensive and valuable. We talked briefly about stocks and shares, which means part of the ownership of a company which people can buy as an investment. And finally, the expression to keep a close eye on, meaning to watch very closely. Dima: Thanks, Kate. Finally, back to our question. Which currency was used in the report to talk about the price of gold? Kate: Well, I said euro, but now I am thinking about again. I think I might have got that wrong. Dima: Yes, and the correct answer was dollar. And that's because like every other major prmotity, gold is prised in dollars. Well, I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. Until next week. Kate: Goodbye!\n",

      "textContent--->Nov 2 Happy to know you guys. I am a senior three student in Zhixin High School, busy preparing for the coming examinations. I major in chemistry but to be honest, I don't think I am fan of it. In contrast, I find physics more attractive. Living in the school six days a week, Zhixin seems to become  my second home, where I live with my friends. Though life there is exhausted, but the graduating year is amazing. I get up at 6.30am usually, and fall into sleep at 11.30pm. God, I spend most of my time on studing and reading. Tired but feeling good. There is one thing that I would like to share with you. The teaching building for senior three has a lift. But the complaint is endless, for continiously, many students or teachers were trapped in it. It broke down with such frequency that none of us was surprised when it broke again. Still, everytime my friends and I use that lift, we are worried. But the school hasn't had a plan to repaired it completely. See you next week. Thank you.\n",

      "textContent--->What's life As I have too much free time being a student librarian, I always think about different endless questions. And the meaning of life is one of my favourite topic to be pondering. 'Live for working or work for living?' is a question raised by my mentee recently. I believe our life should not only be occupied by job. I still believe the meaning of living is awaiting for one's definition, you have to explore the meaning of your existance. Deplorably work for living is a must unless we were born in rich family, otherwise most of us have to put up with our work. When we cannot exclude working from our life, it's really important to have a job that you like, or you have to learn how to adjust yourself to suit the environment. Life is not easy, and nobody said it is easy too. I'm still learning how to accept and adopt the imperfectness of my life.\n",

The 20th Hong Kong Book Fair is being held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. This is a fair which is held in Hong Kong every year. As a book lover, there is no reasons for me not to go there. I really thought I will buy nothing at there at first. But I was wrong indeed. There were so many people go to Book Fair in the past. And the space of the book fair this year is bigger than last year, so it is more comfortable to have shopping. To increase the sales revenue, different publishers has offered an attractive discount for their books. Some of them are really cheap and worth buying it! As a result, I bought nine books at a low price, including English, Chinese and Japanese friction books. Three of them are written by Higashino Keigo, who is a well-known author in Japan. I want to read his book for a long time but didn't have a chance. As I didn't think I will buy anything, I hadn't had so much cash. I am sure I buy a lot more books if I have. Now there are 16 books in my room which I haven't read yet. And I believe I really don't have to buy any more books in this year.\n",

According to the differences in category,scale of producton and requirement of quality this technology can derive three forms of realization,that is,by flotation,by proportion and by electromagnetism. The way by flotation is to separate the two materials by taking advantage of their different floatabilities; by proportion is for the reason that they don’t acount for the same percentages;and by electromagnetism is specific to the electromegnetic ore. The source ores for this program are those from Qielieqike mine which contains three main orebodies,i. e. No.1,No.2,and No/3, thereinto, No.1 and No.2 have close grade.

The good part of living here is you can easily mingle with different etchnic group and learn their language and culture. The drawback are, you might adapt to the mingling languages or local slang 'lah~ leh~ lo~' which could diminish the beauty of your spoken language. And due to at least 2 - 3 languages we need to speak daily with different people, this cause us couldn't focus and have difficulties to become proficient in one language.

It made me aware that one girl's life will change forever after shock,one mother's choice will change her family forever after shock, one memont can change your life forever after shock. It's a moving story, and I really touch about it. Here's the story: Tangshan,1976. Two seven-year-old twin children are buried under the rubble of the the devastating earthquake. The rescue team explains to their mother,Li Yuanni,that freeing either child will almosts certainly result in the death of the other. Forced to make the most difficult decision of her life, she finally chooses to to save her son Fang Da, the male twin. Li Yuanni has no ides that her decision is overheard by her daughter Fang Deng, the female twin. Although she has been left behind as dead, the little girl miraculously survives for several more days before being pulled clear by another rescue team who believe that she is simply a corpse.

      "textContent--->Relax and lonely Today I am still in Chinese new year holiday, I feel relax and peaceful. No more people have harassed me any more. I have had lunch with my previous colleague in MongKok. We had a conversation for about two hours. I talked about everything happened to me for past three months without any lies. I really enjoyed this as I could express my feeling and thought totally. The colleague asked me some difficulties in her work and I gave some advices. I feel a sense of satisfaction as I think I could help her regardless of whether the advice work or not. Then I walked along Nathan Road alone and finally went to Science Museum. I have not been there for a long time. The facilities have no change at all but some are added in the museum to attract more visitor. I finally enjoy some facilities which I did not play last time. However, I feel lonely as no one was shared my happiness. Probably it is the right time for me to call some friends who do not contact for a long time.\n",
      "textContent--->life question after watching ‘scusa ma ti chiamo’ Have you ever imagine fall in love with a girl who is younger than you 20 years old? I am thinking about this question after watching the Italian movie ‘scusa ma ti chiamo’ (sorry if I love you). It’s a story describe above a high school girl fall in love with an advertisement creative director who is 20 years older than her. The movie is comedy which can let you relax and laughing. What makes me curious is how many people could accept fall in love with a person who is younger than you. I can’t imagine such scene would happen to me now! That means I am 24 now and I fall in love with a little girl who is only 4 years old! If I am lucky enough, I could be her father! I would say it’s normal if I loved my 4 yrs old daughter, it’s also normal if I say that 4 years old girls are cutie. But it’s really horrible if I fall in love with them! By the way, I think I would fall in love with a 27 years old lady while I am 47 because men always like young and beautiful ladies. Furthermore, I think I can’t afford others’ discrimination to me if I am serious to this inmate relationship. Although love shouldn’t have any limitation or calculation but nobody can avoid the reality if you want to hold a true, faithful and long experience. I would not choose a difficult and harmful way if I am really stand on her side.\n",

      "textContent--->Assignment--self evaluation In this task my role was Rxx’s Island Sports Foundation (RISF)  Board Member and I was on the FOR side. I had worked to raise  fund for the project and I supposed that this project would bring  prosperity to the island and would create opportunities for the public to enjoy sports. Though I would not say I was the main force in the discussion,  however, I did make some contribution to the team. In the issue of transportation, we were considering possible routes  for weekday shuttle buses which travel students from schools to the island. In my position, I needed to find out a way to minimize our  cost for this extra service. So I suggested 3 stops at Bronx, Rxx’s  Island and Queens, respectively, and bus would go back and forward to pick up students from Bronx and Queens via the island. (There  is MTA bus service from east Harlem to the island so that there’s  no need for extra service.) In this condition, we would need only one bus on this route and the travel time would be less than half an hour as estimated. And at last we ended up with this method. Then we came to the issue of how to raise fund for the  transportation. Someone in the team suggested we can find some  grants because the transportation cost would probably exceed the  current budget. Since my work was to raise fund for this project, it  would be my responsibility to find out more grants or funds suitable  for sports and transportation. Though it was not a main issue in the  task, I did think this was a good idea so I tried hard to find out  some useful grant websites and shared the information to the team. Also I suggested in the future we can hold some activities such as  student volunteer project, which could engage students in  maintenance work for the fields so that students from different schools could communicate with each other and we could cut some cost as well. But the team was so concentrated in field allocation and  transportation issues that they did not show much interest in my  suggestion. And at last I gave some suggestion to our presentation rehearsal. In terms of skill improvement, I do feel my English is not good  enough. I found sometimes I could not express my idea clearly to  the team so that I needed to explain it again, which wasted some  time. So maybe I need more practice on my English in order to  improve my communication skill. Also, I was not firm enough on my suggestion. Take the volunteer  proposition for example, if I would have stick to my position and  elaborate the idea clearly, my teammates may adopt it and we  could have a new issue. Third, I was not as active as some of my teammates during  discussion. I think the reason, besides language as mentioned  above, was that I had so much assignment these weeks that I had  little time for discussion preparation. Anyway, I will try to say more  and be more active in the next task.\n",

      "textContent--->dream PART 1 Last night,i had a dream. The dream started at a strange place that i was locked in a box. It's was halloween that everyone was wearing scary costumes. I walked around and find a old lift that using rope to control. I got in and it began downstair. But there wasn't anything. No wall,no floor but darkness. I tried to get out but i couldn't. Then i went back to the beginning of the dream again. Just like a RPG game that you saved at this place and  reload  afterward. The second time i had forgotten what had happanned but i had forced to back to the reload spot. The third time i was with my friend cici,who is my best friend,walking around in a theme park that people were celebrating  halloween . (Maybe some hongkonger will know that it was the ocean park) We took the elscalator and went upstair. But it suddenly changed into a roller coaster. My friend and I hold each other hand tight in order to balance since this roller coaster had broken rail.(斷軌) If we don't care about it ,we will drop into the ocean and die. Although we could got to another part of rail safely, but  we couldn't did the second time. We jumped out of the roller coaster with hands seperate and caught a part of rail that no roller coaster will pass. We seeked for help but nobody came. I thought that it seemed that we were safe right that moment but i was wrong. Somebody was taking a gun and shotted us. Luckily we didn't get hurt  but my friend dropped into the ocean. I was trying to make the guy focus on me so he will have no time to caught my friend. But it didn't worked. So my friend got killed. I felt heartbreak since she died in  front of me. Then i was forced to back to the reload spot again. The forth time cici was with me again(Wasn't it strange?)but i didn't wanted her to get killed agin, so take her to the eslcaltor. I must find out what was happening to us,i must know the truth. But there wasn't anything that time too. So I planned to go upstair. We didn't get bounded in the dark place. I was so happy that i keep talking to cici. There wasn't anyone beside me but i was carrying a warm sweater. I felt her in the darkness but she disappeared right when i could see because of the light. I lost her again. Then i was forced to the spot again. I finally knew that was a dream. But that was not acceptable to me. \"Why this happen to me!Keeping me lost my best friend!\" I got mad that i keep shouting to the box and kicking it hard. \"Why  i must  dreaming watching my friends dying!\" I began to hit the box with my head,trying to get myself awake. \"Wake up!Wake up!!!!!\" I keep to do that and i \"saw\"  a room . But it turned to box again, so I hitted harder. It changed again and again . But I still  bounded in this nightmare....... (To be cont')\n",

      "textContent--->History of Cherry Blossoms in Vancouver Today, I decided to write an entry in English. I'd love to write this in Japanese or French, but because I really want to share the content of this entry with everyone on Lang-8 without comprehension problems, I've decided to write in a language I'm more familiar with. Forgive me! The picture I've attached was taken just outside my house. It's of a blooming cherry tree. I've always wondered why there are so many flowering cherry trees in Vancouver, Canada. After all, they're not native to this region. So, I decided to check this up on the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival website. The address is as follows: http://www.vcbf.ca/history Apparently, we've been planting cherry trees in Vancouver since the 1930s. During that time, the mayors of Kobe and Yokohama presented us with 500 Japanese cherry trees to honour the Japanese Canadians who had served in the First World War. These trees were planted around the Japanese cenotaph in Stanley Park. Prior to planting cherry trees, we had primarily planted large trees which, upon maturation, became quite a problem in many ways. Their roots invaded sewer lines, heaved the sidewalks, and their canopies interfered with utility lines. Thinking that cherry trees were smaller and prettier, we decided to replace the problematic trees with cherries, amongst other ornamental trees. In 1958, we received 300 more cherry trees from the Japanese consul, Muneo Tanabe, as a symbol of the friendship between the two nations. These were planted along Cambie boulevard, between 49th and 33rd Avenues, in Queen Elizabeth Park, and also around the Japanese monument in Stanley Park. Small ornamental trees, including cherries, continue to be popular in planting operations in Vancouver until the 1990s. By that time, 36% of Vancouver street trees were of the Prunus genus, which includes flowering plums and cherries. Today, the emphasis on planting ornamental trees in Vancouver has decreased due to the fact that large trees are needed for their environmental benefits. Currently, the most popular type of cherry trees planted in the city are the Akebono cherries. These trees tend to perform better in our climate and do not present as many cases of root problems as other types of flowering cherries. Are there flowering cherries where you live too?\n",

His father’s friend asked him ‘how do you protect the world if you don’t clean the room?’ As we all known, detail is the key success.

      "textContent--->Urgent~ What are the most important qualities of a good son or daughter? How these qualities changed or remained the same over time in your culture? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Being a good son or daughter is what we are supposed to be. Without our parents we would not be here. They brought us up with unconditional love. They have provided us the best education, the most comfortable life and have spent lots of their precious time with us. While we still do not have the ability to take care of them yet, being a good son or daughter is the only thing we can do to thank our parents. However, what qualities should a good son or daughter have? The answer tends to be subjective and differs from each other. In my opinion, spending time with parents and taking care of them are the most important qualities a good son or daughter should have, especially when they are getting old. Nevertheless, these qualities have undergone great changes over time. In the past, people would go home after work and spend their time with their parents. They would have meals together and chat with each other about their days, such as their work and things happening around them. As time goes by, the working hours have became longer so people can not spend as much time with their parents as before. What is more, people nowadays spend lots of time on playing computer games, singing karaoke, using the Internet, and so on. People have more sources of entertainment than before. Having less time with their parents makes the relationships less close than before. Other than that, the quality of taking care of their parents has also changed over time. In the past, parents relied on their children to take care of them when they became old. But in recent years, parents do not rely on their children to take care of them anymore. They plan their retired life earlier by saving money or making investments. Moreover, the resistance of going to nursing homes has been lower than before. The responsibility of taking care of parents has been left to the nursing homes. To conclude, the aforementioned changes cannot be the excuses for not spending time with our parents. We should spare time for them. Maybe we will lose our leisure time, but they are the only parents we have. If we do not take care of them, their hearts will surely break.\n",

      "textContent--->A dictionary addict. When I was a student, which was a long long time ago in a far far away land, I had a friend, a fellow student, who was addicted to a dictionary. You could always count on him to have the dictionary somewhere around whenever you needed to look up a word or two. I've ('d?) never seen him with a book - always with the dictionary. And he was reading it as if you would read a book, page by page. Sitting in a library, a canteen, a cafe, a corridor, a park - you name it. What's more, he was reading it on a bus or any other mean of transport - no matter whether public or not. It seems that thanks to this constant human-dictionary connection, he himself became a kind of (a?) walking dictionary. All the other students knew he knew (had known?) all the words they didn't know. We, the other students, were making a bit of innocent fun of his dictionary addiction but you know what, we weren't the ones to laugh last, he was. The dictionary addict became the best student in his year and passed all his exams with flying colours. We were so envious! Well, a wise saying says: he who laughs last laughs longest. I wonder if he's still laughing ;) Thanks for reading my idle chatter. Any comments will be most welcome.\n",

Write   a replay to Mark`s letter giving news about how you are settling in to your new surroundings and what a typical day is like. You should also say whether or not you can accept his invitation to go and stay on his farm in the summer. Dear Mark,  Thanks for Your last letter, and I`m sorry that I haven`t written for so long. I`m really happy that Your the oldest sheepdog has puppies. You know that I like dogs and I hope that one of them will be mine. I`m fine that I moved and bought a new house. It is unusual and very special place for me. I enjoy simple, good things and the peace and quiet of the countryside. Scenery is breathtaking, rugged snow-capped mountains in the interior in every season,surrounding deep blue sky, a lot of fresh air and deadly silence. Local people are really friendly and helpful. My typical day starts at six o`clock when I  get up and feed my sheep, after that I return at home and having breakfast. It`s not over yet, because I must do it several times during a day. Anyway please forgive me,  but I am not going to go to You in this summer,       but I invite you to my farm, so we can spend this summer together. Keep in touch. Best wishes\n",

      "textContent--->Code Milky Green! \t‘The Big Bang Theory’ at first I thought another silly sitcom, boredom, additionally there has been a hype about this show, people around recommend this to each other. They said: ‘You must see it. We bet you will enjoy that nerdy show’. I have to admit that I always try to avoid overrated things. So I tried to do it this time. Simply I don’t like doing something because the majority does. \tBut to be honest, I was so curious about that show so I couldn’t resist watching at least first part. I’ve turned the first episode and suddenly I saw Sheldon and thought: dear god, this is that creepy guy who appeared in ‘Garden State’. I remember he had sexual intercourse with his friend’s mother during  he was speaking to her Klingon. Ok, I thought, if that weirdo is there it must be a pretty good show. And I must to say that it is. \tA love that guys, they were super smart, socially awkward, riddle with obsessive compulsion and a purist about every single piece of geek pop culture. In addition they play off nerd stereotypes, all that things caused that I couldn’t stop watching them. What I like more is all that references to pop culture like movies, comics, and video games that people like me will lap up. \tI should admit that one of my friends is like Sheldon meets up with Wolowitz. Everybody knows he’s got problems with girls. You know he has to put amount of effort to ask any girl to go out with him, but he pretends he hasn’t, he plays stud, tries to show off and tells us how many girls dating with him. He has difficulties even with getting in touch with girls because he treats them at first as a potential sexual objects. Girls can intuit that he sees in them only tits and consider him as a slimy. It sounds ridiculous I know. On the other hands he likes smarting off. He loves it. You know how annoying could be people who always thought they were the smartest in the world. Sometimes they are real pain in the neck.\n",

      "textContent--->I'd be gratefull for some help with this text. ; ) This article was written by Holly Kearl, who's leading a blog called 'Stop Street Harassment'. She wrote a book which also deals with this topic. The article is about approaching new people we would like to meet and how to do it correctly. The most important factor is treating other persons with respect. We shouldn't use words like \"baby' or 'honey' because some people may find that offensive. Comments about their appearance are not necessary too. Body language is also very important. If we see that someone doesn't want to talk with us by his/her tone of voice or eye contact we should just leave that person alone. If  we are unsure, the best way is to ask if he/she has a time and willingness to talk with us. Approaching new people at a desert and dark area may make them feel uncomfortable and unsafe, especially if we are much older or have friends with us when they are alone. We should avoid these factors and make it clear that our intentions are totally positive. If someone turns us down, we shouldn't curse or insult that person. It's inappropriate and their reactions may have nothing to do with us personally. Some people just want to get to their destination or just enjoy nice weather and air. Society suggests that it is men who should approach women. But they are constantly being told by media, family, peers, that it is OK to be aggressive or to sexually objectify women. So it's really important to let young men know about an appropriate interactions in public. There are some programs that counteract these harmful messages, for example 'The Consensual Project' in Washington. Founder Ben Privot gives workshops on college campuses about how to meet someone properly on the street. The other campaigns are \"One Step Too Far\" in Wales or \"Parivartan\" in India. They try to resolve a problem of street harassment or \"eve teasing\". We all should think about appropriate ways of meeting new people. Public places and streets are good place for that as well, we just need to respect each other and try to make our interaction funny. It's the only way to open the door for further conversations.\n",
      "textContent--->Procrastination Here is a short story about my own personal battle with procrastination and how I somehow manage to cheat myself to do some work instead of just surfing the internet. On a typical day, I start my working day by checking a few feeds I follow. Trouble is if people have had a productive day I will find every other link interesting and will subsequently dive deep into articles and videos. This has potential to fill my day and kill all productivity. Obviously if I wasn't able to find a way to manage it somehow I would have been long unemployed. 2 tips I can share with everyone who wants to take back the control: 1) Plan your activities ahead. If there's a void in your mind your thoughts will will in it and make you wander until lunchtime. Know what you want to achieve. Divide bigger tasks into smaller chunks to make them seem easy to accomplish 2) Measure your working time. I use pommodoro technique, which requires you to work in 25 minutes sprints and then have 5 minutes compulsory breaks in between. I use a simple piece of software called Focus Booster to do the measurment. Works great provided I can actually be bothered to stick to my own technique!\n",

      "textContent--->About learning foreign languages There are some ways for accelerate learning new languages. I've just started using it, so I'll try it and share it with you. -- Tip number 1 --  Associations. This is a easy way for remember new words by making an association between the word that you already know (in your native language or language that you know) and word that you try to remember. Making association means that you connect these two words in one story. For example. I will try to remember Spanish word : \"hombre\" which means \"man\". If I was English native speaker I would make an association by connecting word \"hombre\" with some English word which is similar in spelling or sounds similar to other word. Let's look for word \"hombre\", I can see that it's look like connection of hom(e) and bre(aking), so I'll prepare association by mixing in one story words man, home and breaking. In the result I could imagine man breaking to my home. So in that way I've created simple connection in my mind. It's easy way to remember every word in foreign language. Try it, have fun!\n",

As I said they are posted on youtube so access is really easy. I've already watched a few of them, and they are amazing. People who play in them are usually PhD or professors. In spite of quite difficult topics, there are usually many scientists and complex experiments behind every concluson they present, they can put these subjects across in an accessible way. They present it in a way which keeps you interested in to the end. After I have watch a few more, I'll try to write about one of them.\n",

Nowadays the people are becoming a information society, where the use and distribution of information is significant in numerous fields of social and economical live. Today, in the of globalization, we need to consider  the communication as an international interchange of information and the communication above the borders starts to mean also the intercultural one. I am quite sure that after analyzing the key facts both the protagonists and antagonists of the idea of globalization would admit, that the idea of globalization is getting true. The frequency of human migrations and the increasing number of international travels constitute a proof of rising mobility of inhabitants of the global village. In this situation the intercultural contacts, before reserved for the diplomats and merchants, are becoming the part of the daily life of an average citizen.\n",

We're supposed to write a short essay regarding a question that we raise ourselves, although the topic has to be in the field of American literature from the Native American myths to the Puritan Era We've been thinking about doing something about the relation between the Native American culture and the work of the colonialists, but we're not sure whether or not it will bring us towards any conclusions. I'd be more than happy to talk and discuss these matters with anybody who likes such stuff :). Thank you very much!\n",
      "textContent--->Advice fro travellers going to Poland This is my English homework. =.= Advice for Japanese travellers going to Poland The People In general- the Polish are not smiling on the streets, they always complain about everything and love looking back communism when, of course, all things were better. Vast majority pf myths about Polish are true. But please don’t be afraid- Polish people love Japanese. It doesn’t mean, however, they can distinguish you from Chinese or Korean. If you meet a J-enthusiast, be prepared for answering a lot of stupid questions about Naruto, Bleach, Sailor Moon, sushi and best entertainment they ever have: ‘how to say in Japanese…’. Cuisine During your trip in Poland you will find a lot of odd food. Strange-looking, hot and spicy cabbage eaten with plums and bread, gyōza stuffed with potatoes and white cheese called pierogi and may many more. And nothing Polish would look like rice. On the other hand the new national meals of Poland are sushi and kebab, 5 sushi bars in one street is enough, and you will meet the most snobbish society in this country. Culture  The most important thing to know about is the fact that Chopin came from Poland. And it is not a stupid joke. Another aspect about Polish culture you should know: the national epic of Poland was written in Paris and starts with words ‘Lithuania, my country!’.\n",

I't just few sentences but I will appreciate your opinion :-) \"Sometimes I wonder if there is something like a destiny. Do we all have paths that are unconsciously taken by our minds? Or, maybe only some people, the chosen ones, are able to make a set of choices, which should be made, if one wants to follow the red string of destiny, instead of cutting it or being entwined with it, to the point of suffocation. If destiny exists, I would like to have one colored light blue, like the vast sky, crossed only with some soft, candy floss looking and nacreous clouds, which will remind me about the existence of wind. Maybe my life would be boring, unlike the beings with red and orange colored destinies, I won’t be able to warm other people’s souls. But, unlike wanting to ignite passion, I would be content with giving peace and tranquility to those who surround me. Lust and passion cannot be understood, and they can only give some fleeting happiness. Living without them is easier, more productive and pragmatic. Or so were my thoughts before I met that person.\"\n",

      "textContent--->What time is it? Since ancient times people has been trying to measure the time. At first they observed the sky and watching stars moving on it they could determine for instance when year seasons start or that the year have 365 days. This way has been in use for a very long time, but as a technology has developed, it appeared that more precise ways of measuring time are required. It was also discovered, that the Earth doesn't necessarily spin around at steady pace. Wind pushing over mountains and influence of the Moon can slow it down or hasten it a little. It is a matter of miliseconds, but for some reason which now I can't remember it was unacceptable. Still looking at stars, examinig them, it was discovered that stars emit light which reach the Earth in even intervals. This discovery created an opportunity of measuring time in the more exact way than ever before... to be continued\n",

When Chester (vocalist) stopped singing in the middle of the song, I could hear funs singing very loud. The only thing I was not really happy about was the length of the show. It was too short!

Hi guys, I've got something different this time, no more stupid babbling about my past week, I've written few simple words on the topic I found in my Student Book. Do you think it is a good idea to leave home and live independently when you go to the university or college? In my opinion it's a great idea but it depends on many factors. It for example depends on what kind of person you are, what do you expect from your life, ff you like to live comfortably with your parents, do not worry about money or anything else. When you live in your family home you can be sure that you will have your clothes washed and your hot meals will be prepared. It also depends on how much money do you or your parents have, because it's much more cheap when you stay at home, don't live intependently. They could simply don't be able to afford your \"independency\". When you're studying at the university or in the college you'll propably not have much time to work, to be able to afford living on your own account. Of course I'm sure that is a great experience to get, I think it let you to learn how to take care of yourself, responsibility for yourself and the others. It teach you how to organize your life and your closest surround. I would choose leaving home and living independently if I had the opportunities for that. I've had to go to work pretty soon, but it was only my choice. Unfortunately salary in polish realities are very low and even working after buisness hours usually 20 hours a week, I still can't afford leaving out home and live on my own.\n",

Exactly a year ago (on 10th April 2010 ) a Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft of the Polish Air Force crashed near the city of Smoleńsk, Russia, killing 96 people on board. Including the Polish president Lech Kaczyński and his wife , the chief of the Polish General Staff and other senior Polish military officers, the president of the National Bank of Poland, Poland's deputy foreign minister, Polish government officials, 12 members of the Polish parliament, senior members of the Polish clergy, and relatives of victims of the Katyń massacre. They were en route from Warsaw to attend an event marking the 70th anniversary of the genocide in Katyń Forest. The pilots attempted to land at Smoleńsk North Airport but because of the thick fog that reduced visibility they had troubles with landing. Pilots of Polish aircraft were misinformed so that the aircraft was too low as it approached the runway. The aircraft struck trees, rolled upside down and broke apart killing everyone on board... It is very sad that a year has passed  and present Polish government actually didn’t do anything (or done not much) to get back wreck of the aircraft from Russia to Poland (even there were some problem with burial of victims). And an average Polish person rather do not know much details about under what circumstances they died because officially Polish government has not yet published its report about it. And Russians rather doesn’t seem to help us in establishing the details.. And it is even more sad that this year on the 1st anniversary of this disaster Russians secretly exchanged boards in Smoleńsk for new one with that difference that they omitted to mention these words I quote disaster victims died on the way to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Soviet genocide in Katyń Forest. Unquote. (After so many years Russian government doesn’t want to confess to genocide in Katyń Forest and plead guilty about it...) So.. now the board looks like this : http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/4/9404/z9404504X.jpg Here you can see what have left after this crash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec_UHl6GNgs&NR=1&feature=fvwp\n",

I'm sorry for the length.. it should be about 150-200 word, but it's 304.. It's an essay that I wrote at 2 am for my english classes. :)  \"Some people believe that our modern lifestyle is very unhealthy. However we tend to live longer than we lived a hundred years ago. How would you explain that?\" Every generation has it own lifestyle. I cannot say that nowadays people live healthier than in the past and that is why I agree just up to the point. To begin with I will write about the main aspect of our lives and that is what we eat. The fact that we live longer and longer does not mean that we rather choose ’real food’ to very popular fast food. There is a little bit of the truth in that, but I think it is a result of the place where we live and our modern medicine. For instance in medieval people had worked physical which had a strong injury in their health. Their lives was based only on working for somebody and meeting two ends together. People did not have an acces to the medicine as we have nowadays. They were tired, ill and of course were living shorter then we live now because we have easier and less stressful jobs. The second, we cannot say that people stick to only one lifestyle. There are some who spend whole life sitting in front of TV or computer and some who like active life. They are doing the sports, hanging out with friends and working on their skills. Also our characteristics have a influent in how long we live. Somebody who is confident and others do not make him being stressed will probably live longer then a solitary person who is afraid of everything he or she has to struggle in life. I think that saying how unhealthy out lifestyle is, might be wrong because everybody has it own way of living and of course a free will. The only thing we can do is teaching kids in schools and making the campaigns about healthy life.\n",

Young couples very often don't have enough money to buy own flat. Wedding party is it also very expensive. In Poland organization of this type of event (for 80 people) cost even tenfold average Polish month salary! You may think, that 80 people is very much. I thought so too before I tried create my list of guests. Believe me, 80 in this case means something about 20! You have to remember, that your spouse also want to invite some guests. But a 40 is still not a 20, so where is a catch? There is a good practice, to invite not only person, with you want to meet on your party, but also accompanying of this person. This mean that if you want to invite 5 co-workers and 7 friends from student days, you have to be prepared for 24 people in fact. 16 invitations left, but parents, grandparents, family of uncle Bobby, family of uncle John and couple of neighbors, can easily run out this limit. A limit for number of invitations is very difficult to adjust. But you don't have to choose between your friends and a loan. In my case double wedding solves everything :) Let my explain. In catholic culture marriage should be established in the church at front of the God. However, law requires only a civil marriage, which can be established in registry office. Catholic marriage can be simultaneously a civil marriage, but it don't have to :) So, this is our schedule of weddings: 30th April - civil marriage 25th August - catholic marriage Party after civil wedding is going to be mostly for co-workers and friends. It will be in music club like this: http://www.antidotum.wroc.pl/taxonomy/term/6 . On the other hand, party after catholic wedding is going to be mostly for family and few friends (the best ones ;) ) It will be in: http://www.casanuova.pl/wesela/index1.php?id=galeria3 As you can guess, party in a music club is less expensive. That is my idea for our worries :) -------------------------------------------------------- I have a request for you.

      "textContent--->Place for fire Tomorrow will be end of the year of school, so my classes planed to organse a fire, grilling cabbages - party at the fire. We wanted to organise in a forest near my house, there was benches from previous fire-party. I didn't even suspect that somebody could brake benches, destroy my work. I and myfriend had prepared those branches for previous fire-party. The fire-party had been great. I'll never forget about that time. In June somebody broke benches, I suspect it was third class from my school. Problem is that girls doesn't want to go 2km further to new place for party-fire. This place was prepared by others, we didn't used this place, because on spring there is wet, but on summer this place is good. Sadly is that in Poland destruction work for everybody, public property is daily.\n",

      "textContent--->Eastern  Eastern in poland its time to spend time with family . People visit their relatives and eat together meals. For a lot of poles eastern begins on Munday Thursday. People go then to the church and confess. But the most important days of entire Eastern for everone its Saturday and Sunday On Saturady almost in every polish home people pull ot baskets from cupboards and decorate it by bilberry. A lot of people also decorate their baskets by small yellow chicken toys. After that, we put into our baskets food eg. bread , butter, a lot kind of meats, and of course eggs-boiled egg . Eggs are the most important part in entire basket. They are a symbol of new life and commemorate the Resurrection oj Jesus. People in Poland decorate eggs, before they put it into baskets. They paint it, draw flowers on it, give eggs nice colours. It looks really nice. When baskets are ready, people take it and go to the Church. In church priest conducts short service and consecrates the food ( which are in baskets). Then people can back home, but a lot of them , stay in church and pray. After the visit in church, baskets are putted on into fridge and they are waiting to the next day. On Sunday usually entire family get up earlier and eat cibsecrated food. During the breakfast they share on eggs ( this consecrated one). They should share... but this tradition is being disappeared. After this meal , people ususally go to other relatives in order to share on eggs with them or just talk. The last day of Eastern in Poland is ( i think ) the most amired by kids. It is Monday and its called Śmigus dyngus. On this day people pour in water each other. You can be pour in water by somebody, even you dont really know this person. On Smigus dyngus is a lot of children on the streets with bottles of water and full big buckets. And roads are really wet then. This game was a symbol of purfication, but now it is just a fun play.\n",
      "textContent--->'to swear' If I'm not mistaken, the verb 'to swear' has two meanings. I'm pretty sure you all know what I mean, but just to make things clear, let me remind you that it either means to make a solemn promise or (to?) use offensive language. I've always found it amusing that the same word can have a positive and a negative meaning at the same time. Somehow, it suggests the positive swearing and the negative swearing have something in common. Polish, my mother tongue, has two words for the two mentioned meanings. We use the verb \"kląć\" to speak of using offensive language and the verb \"przysiąc\" is used when speaking of making promises. On the second thought, there is an expression in Old Polish which seems to confirm the speculation of (an) intertwined nature of the two meanings of swearing. Although it would sound old-fashioned a Pole could say: Klnę się na wszystkie świętości, że mówię prawdę. (I swear by all that is sacred that I'm telling the truth.) - using the same verb which they would choose to describe someone using swear words. Strange.\n",

      "textContent--->The film I really want to watch Today I’m going to watch a film titled ‘Green Mile’. This film is an adaptation of the book written by Stephen King. I’ve read ‘Green Mile’ recently and I find it’s excellent. King’s writing style is very specific, he fantastically builds an atmosphere of terror. His books are long, but he uses to build his characters from scratch, creating his tempers very carefully and little by little, and it makes them very real. He overmastered creating heroes to a fare-thee-well. He carved out his own, personal, urepeatable writing style. I think it must be very hard to adapt his books and it’s a big challenge for moviemakers to do it well. I’m very curious of this film.\n",

      "textContent--->Harry Potter - My first English-language book. Hi, Today I'd like to share with my experiences which refer to reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. I've already read only 7 chapters but I must admit that reading it in oreginal version is something special. When reading it, I have to focus on the text as twice as normally consequently, I comprehend, and spot an great amount of details in comparishion with the first time I read this in my mother language. Firstly, I was detered by enormousness of vocabulary I'd not known, then I listened to advice of my friend to give a try, at least for 30 days, He said \"If you don't like it I will help you burn this damp book presonally, but give a shot\" and that inclined me to try. Then, work began. It was hard at first but I relised that full comprehension of text (every single word) gives pleasure of reading. It stimulate your imagination to picture wverything in your head and definitely (if the book is good) enchant the reader. H. Potter is beyond doubt that type of book. Learning by heart so many words is tough but the key here is determination. I can assure those who are not into reading books in other languages that the learning vocabulary cannot be compared with learning in school. You're doing it in your own pace and whenever you have time so only feeling that accompany learning is pleasure and complacency. Many words are repeated in book so if you learn it once on the beginning, you will not forget it easily. That's all for today. Greetings :) \n",
      "textContent--->Specyfying my language goal. Hi! As some of you can remember from my very first post, I have a language goal. It's following: to speak American English fluently with strong accent until this year ends. (By the way - do you know any better way to say 'until this year ends'? I would be glad if you could write some in comment.) Today, I specified it. Now, it sounds like this: to speak American English fluently with strong accent and to pass CPE exam in the last term in this year. It's now much better, because it gives me a lot of pressure to learn English even more hard than I've learned before. I am going to do something I call 'total immersion in English', what means that I am going to use it all time when I can. What do you think about my language goal actualization? ;>\n",
      "textContent--->My opinion on islamization of Europe Islamization of Western Europe is a very controversial issue. Every year thousands of immigrants from the Africa and the Near East move to the Europe. They cause a lot of problems such as robberies, assaults and murders. They usually don't work, so they get social benefits (e. g. child benefits, unemployment benefits etc.). Immigrants often create ghettos in suburbs. Most of them are Muslims. There are more and more mosques for instance in the Paris or London. This situation is a result of multiculturalism policy. I think that governments of Western Europe made serious mistake giving immigrants the green light. I hope that european politicians will recognise threats of immigration and they will start to do something. I am not prejudiced against Muslims but I want to tell that the menace of Islamic Europe is very real. European values such as freedom, christian civilization or respect to women can not to survive. Killing spree of Andres Breivik in Norway should suprise no one. His act of terrorism is a very dangerous manifestation of animosity towards left-wing politicians who support the immigration. And what do you think on Muslim immigrants?\n",

It has a population of 70,000 people but it's a peaceful, lovely piece of Earth. It calls Gniezno. Historians says that Gniezno is a first, legendary capital of Poland. In the center stays Romanesque/Gothic cathedral. There are also restaurants and cafes. We have a spacious promenade too. My favourite place is \"Ratuszowa Restaurant\" which means \"Town Hall Restaurant\". I can drink there the best cold caffee in my town. It's perfect, believe me! Have a nice day!\n",
      "textContent--->Message in a Movie The next article,which I’ve recently  read, is titled  ‘Message in a Movie’. This is a summary. It has long been tempted to link Roman Polanski’s films to the director’s private life. The 'Ghost Writer', which is the artist’s latest film, is no exception. The political thriller, based on a novel by Robert Harris, follows a ghost writer hired by former British prime minister Adam Lang to draft his memoirs. The Tony-Blair-inspired Lang is indicated by The International Criminal Court for war crimes in Iraq. The writer slowly reveals a conspiracy. For most of the rest of the  film, they remain holed up at the beach house- not unlike Polanski, who was under house arrest in a Swiss resort, as he finishes his work. In one scene near the movie’s start, it’s impossible to miss the echo when Lang’s lawyer advises him not to return home for fear of arrest at the airport upon his arrival. Polanski was arrested just after he landed at Zurich airport. The author of the article claims that it was a bit of mystery why the Swiss arrested him then. In the middle of postproduction, Polanski suddenly found himself in a prison and he continued to work in his cell. Now Polanski has to wear an electronic bracelet to keep him from absconding to France, where he might avert  from extradition. In the film, neither Lang nor his ghost writer can escape their  pursuers. The author of the article asked how Polanski’s thriller illuminates his own legal case. Whether life imitates art to the end remains to be seen. Nina\n",

      "textContent--->Could you read and correct? In Poland 52% of Polish students begin work on the first year, or even before. . The high costs associated with studios, particularly for learners outside the place of his residence, one of the reasons to combine learning with work. The most aggravating for student budgets are expenses associated with renting a flat payment of tuition and travel to their home village. Next, the students spend money on entertainment, postpone the vacation and electronic equipment such as laptops and portable music players. students should find this work so as not to interfere with studies. Finding jobs for young people becomes independent financially. In Poland you can start working after completing the age of sixteen. more and more teenagers take to work in the holidays. They want to earn their own needs and pleasures. Work is no dimension of students not merely financial, but also shows how seriously the young man takes his career. The desire to gain new experience, willingness to work.\n",
      "textContent--->Noble Mistake (story) Attention: this story is written in an unordinary style, please don't crticise it. I'm posting it here to get corrections not critics. And it contains some boyxboy issue so if it offens you, just quit reading :) ** He sent him an SMS. First Second. Seventh… Fifteenth….. He stopped counting. He didn’t even want to know how many times he phoned him. Numbers have lost their sense. It could be one as well as ninety-nine. It could last one hour as well as three seconds or days. The only question was why… Why was he doing this? He met this immature brat few times before. They yelled, argued, they’ve almost killed each other. And then after many years  (yeah ‘many’ was the only number making any sense at the moment… but was ‘many’ a number?) After so many years he saw him on the street. Stronger but lonely. Smiling but sad. He didn’t know why but he felt like giving him a hand. A helpful one. And he did… They went to the café. Just like that, like the past was nothing. Because they didn’t mind the past. They were interested in present. One of them was afraid of future and one of them wasn’t afraid of anything. One of them was still fighting and the other one has lost long time ago… They talked like old friends; drinking some coffee and eating chocolate muffins. Because chocolate is our best friend. It will always make us smile and will never disappoint us. This is the friend everyone dreams about and nobody knows about. But he knew. And he wanted to help him. So he gave him chocolate. And it helped. And he was grateful. He needed a person to talk to. He needed to say this. To shout this. He wanted to share his thoughts with whole world. But he couldn’t. It wasn’t what others wanted to hear. They only wanted to know he’s fine. So he said he was fine. Why not? If it made their lives easier. One less problem was very comfortable for them. It was comfortable thinking everything’s fine. And what if it wasn’t? Who knew… He knew. He told him everything. Every single sorrow, every single phantom of the past and the future. And then he wondered if giving him this hand was a right choice. He didn’t know. What happened later remains a mystery. He didn’t notice leaving the café. He didn’t notice getting drunk…  He only noticed waking up the next day in a hotel room, horrible headache and faint scent of pansies… The scent he will never forget. He had a feeling something wrong has happened. Something wrong but also something great… Noble. And he wanted to remember… but he couldn’t. And then he said to himself he will never drink again…  Never drink again without him, he added after a while. He ignored the headache and got up. He almost fall down. But tried his best and stood up. He looked around, looked through the window, looked into the fridge. And he only found a little piece of pink stick-in paper with a phone number. And now he’s been swearing at this little paper. Why the hell did he take it?! He should have left it where he’d found it and forget about this event. Just like always. But he didn’t. He took it, saved number and tried to contact him now. Was he getting old? ** He’s been sitting on the couch watching his cell’s display. It was vibrating all the time announcing new messages. First message Second message. Seventh… Fifteenth….. It was a lot, but the phone kept vibrating. He didn’t want to count anymore. He felt guilty enough. Why did he agree for that? Was he that desperate?! To open his heart to him? Maybe it was too much already. He hated politics, he hated economics, he hated all of the issues… Sometimes he dreamt about leaving this corrupted country and disappearing for a week… month… year…  Whole life maybe. Why not? Would anybody notice? Or would they go on without him? Yeah, he wouldn’t be surprised. Day-dreaming was his favorite activity lately. He could finally run away from this gray reality. He could do anything – swim, sleep, visit, rest, relax…  The phone stopped. Why? Lack of money… or intentions? It made him sad… More than he already was. He shouldn’t mind…. But he did. He tried to remember what happened last day: He’s been walking on the street, wearing his everyday mask of smiling idiot. Everybody get fooled… except of him. He met his glance and knew that he knew. But… Why him? He was the one he hated the most. He fought and then humiliated him. And then the roles changed. He didn’t regret the past but, in fact, didn’t mind it now. He had other, more up to date problems. He’s seen extended hand. His hand. He shook it. And their conflict was over. They went to the café. And talked. He talked actually. He felt like throwing this out of his mind. And he let him talk. He’s been listening with interest. With understanding. And he felt like spending more time with him. Like drinking and singing and shouting and laughing and having fun together. For the first time for many years he felt something warm inside. And then he woke up. The dream has finished…  Was it a bad dream? A good dream? A nightmare? He looked around… Was it a dream?! He was next to him. Looking so different in a sleep. So innocent. So unlike himself. So…  He sighed. He had to go. He didn’t feel what he felt last day. He made a mistake…. He left the room and came back home. But he left something… He’s left another mistake. Now, sitting on the couch, he turned the mobile off. Vibrating was too distracting, he had to think a little…  ** Thanks for reading, hope you enoiyed :)\n",

      "textContent--->Franz Kafka - Process  Process was made by a famous Austrian writer – Franz Kafka, who was not appreciated in his times, unfortunately. It's a quite simple story which takes place in some unknown big city in XX century. Those informations however are not necessary. We had better focus on personality of Józef K. who is a main character. What led him to dreadful consequences was his harmful attitude for life. Józef K. was celebrating his 30 birthday when two wardens entered his room saying he is being arrested, without a cause. That's how the absurd and terror starts to mingle. Józef K. visits many of ignorant and unqualified judges just to find a pornographic magazines in place of penal codes. We can observe gradually change of main character – from confusion and rebel to completely giving up. An unbelievably climax is murder of Józef K. The whole story has got a figurative pronunciation. We are somehow arrested and enslaved by a inevitable death and consumptional style of life. There's no chance for making any togetherness. That's how ended up lonely egoist focusing only on success. The strong point of the novel is skillful using language – onirisme and terror makes an unusual atmosphere. The plot is quite dynamic and a reader really can feel like Józef. Millions ways of interpretations makes the novel still actual. I can thoroughly recommend it to everyone who likes psychological topics with a pint of philosophy. Who knows, maybe it would change your life?\n",

      "textContent--->Contrast higher and lower education (in Poland) In May, this year high school graduates in Poland have final tests. Their grades will decide if they can apply to higher education. Many of them do not even know yet what  higher education is and how does it differ from lower education. I want to focus on discrepancies. There are three main differences between higher and lower education. These are choice, the scope of material and qualifications.\t Firstly, I want to take into consideration a matter of choice. As probably most of people know, lower education, on the contrary to higher education, is compulsory. Our law states, that till we reach the age of eighteen we have to continue education on lower degree. After that time we can leave off education because higher education is just a matter of our choice. After high school we decide if want to continue our education or not, whereas while starting lower education we do not have choice like this. \tThe second difference is the scope of material. During time spent in lower education’s institutions students have to master very general material, whereas higher education offers more concrete knowledge. That is so because lower education, I can say, prepares people to everyday life. Knowledge offered by this kind of education is obligatory for every person. Conversely, knowledge, we possess during studying on higher education’s institutions, is focused on one particular course, that we are interested in. \tThe third thing is connected with qualifications. People tend to think that lower education does not offer us concrete knowledge. By deduction, it does not give us any qualifications to do some particular job. As opposed to lower education, higher education gives us opportunity to be specialized in one subject (of course only if we end our studies). The reason why people choose to study few more years is the gulf between possibilities to be an expert after lower and higher education. \tTo sum up, there are far more differences between higher and lower education. Choice, the scope of material and qualifications just highlight a number of other differences that left to discuss. They should be took into consideration by this future student while deciding: to start higher education or not.\n",

      "textContent--->How to not kill your orchid. I am a happy owner of two orchids. Happy because they are still alive. The first one has white flowers and the second one has dark pink flowers. They are really fit and beautiful plants and when they bloom I am enchanted with them. Both my orchids have already finished blossoming. Orchids have a very sensitive to humidity roots. If you water them to often the roots will rot and the plant will fade. The proper watering  frequency is every 7 to 14 days. In order to determine  if  the watering time has come you need to check the colour of roots. If they are dark green it means the plant don't need watering. When they become silver it means you can water your orchid. There is a special way of watering. You don't just use watering can but you must dip the pot  in the bucket of  water for 20 minutes, because the roots must be irrigated evenly. After this time you have to drain off the pot carefully so that the roots don't stay submerged in water. To do this you can stand the pot on the granulate with   hygroscopic properties.\n",

      "textContent--->National Stereotypes Stereotypes in short are kind of 'opinions' we made about something, basing only on rumors, gossips, opinions from other people etc. They are also constant, which means - they doesn't change even if are different than reality. One of the popular polish stereotypes is that it always rains in London. So if there is sunny - nobody says a word, but when it's raining indeed \"See? A told you!\" phrase can be heard. Today I'd like to write about national stereotyping. In other words: what people of one nation thinks about others. Some of them might be funny, other sad or cruel. If anybody will feel insulted - I'm sorry. Please keep in mind that those opinions are the most frequent but doesn't represent the whole Poland. These are stereotypes ONLY! Germans - Germans are well known of being rich and having very colorful clothes (especially during winter). Although every German has his own car, they used to travel using trekking sticks. They are pretty liked in Poland, however sometimes are still connected with World War II or medieval events. (We used to have wars many many times in past.) German little boys always have long, blond, curly hair and likes football. Russians - Known as greatest brothers and comrades of Poles. We sing together, drink together, fight together and die together. Despite cruel history, they are still considered as best friends. Czech - Not much about them. They talks funny, and when you have trouble you can be sure that they will be first.. to flee. Liked. Norwegian and Finnish - Even more richer and colorful that Germans and our greatest rivals in Sky Jumping also. Highly advanced technologically. All of them listen to Heavy Metal and have long hair or beard. Most beautiful women. Ukrainians - Cossacks. Bohun tribe. Same as Russian but tougher. Liked by women. Italians - They likes to talk a a lot and fight each other. Occasionally slave some polish workers. Liked though. Spanish and Greek - Most handsome. Beloved by women. French - Because of WW2 events not very liked and known as.. well.. cowards and traitors. A little arrogant as well. English, Irish and Scottish - Similar to France. Also know of being a little.. anemic. This stereotype evolves fast though, because of current migration-boom. They slowly becomes to be \"almost-like-normal\". They are mostly liked. United States Americans - Well, that's a hard one. American white people are generally not liked in Poland, and considered overweighted, arrogant and poorly educated. They are also known as barbarians, who doesn't respect other cultures and thinks that all problems can be solved by Fists, Fire, and F22. Black people who represents \"gangsta style\" ale beloved by polish Hip Hop fans (youth mostly) though. Famous 'Americans Scientists' are also known of doing research of everything that exist. Chinese - Extremely well organized, working like ants. Having good food and funny smiles. Oddly not so liked. Japanese - Chinese who got robots, anime, and katanas. Japanese tourist always makes A LOT of photos, points things with their fingers and are always smiled. I think that would be all for now :) And as I said before - if ANYBODY feel insulted - I'm truly sorry. No offense please.\n",

      "textContent--->The week-long frustration Sometimes I hate the approach of surrounding me people to my education. I plan to go at the university to study medicine and to become a doctor, and I have got really big chances to accomplish that particular intention. My class share my interests or dream about academic career. My high school is one of the best twenty high schools in Poland, so over 50% of my friends will fulfil their hope. Nevertheless, my Polish teacher cannot understand that I spend 8 hours at school daily, then I have to waste over 3 hours to arrive to and return from school, as I live 20km from the capitol - and trains are so crowded that there is no place to take out a notebook or textbook and learn, which  gives 11 hours daily in total, then I have to sleep at least for 6 hours  - I tried to sleep only 4, but on Fridays' afternoons I used to not notice cars and other lethal objects. It makes 17 hours daily. There lasts 24 - 17 = 7 hours, but I have to take a shower 'sometimes', wash hair 'sometimes', change clothes 'sometimes', eat at least 1800 kcal daily to survive and you must agree with me that doing these things is obligatory at least once a day, and it would be a pleasure to eat three times. It takes 3 hours (I'm a girl and I have some needs, I wouldn't be able to bear being dirty, would I.)So, for my studies I have got now 4 hours. Pretty much of time? Forget it! 2 hours takes homework, and I have 2 pets and a psychic construction which refuse to have less than 15 minutes of relax a day. All in all, I have got as much as 1-2 hours to expand my knowledge, study for ALL exams in next week - lately, 3 exams from different subjects (I have to constantly divide my attention between unconnected sections of education, and as there is 1 up to 3 hours from every among 13, it all ends in learning definitions by heart from bad-written textbook (we have a class game - who finds more errors and misleading fallacies in current chapter. I have got 15 points). What's the meaning behind forcing intelligent people to do something that they hate and to which they resist when the same effect might have been obtained in a more pleasure and cheaper way, where students would not forget all the definitions a moment after graduation? Arranging the time for the future Polish doctors, scientist, journalists, lawyers, programmers, academic lecturers, architects, economists, politicians to hinder them from getting real knowledge and to not allow them walking 'at large'? I would like to have time for anatomy, physiology, pharmacy, physics, chemistry an biology studies, because all of them will build up my future career. I dream about taking a part in a national biology contest, but now there is no chance that I will prepare for it properly. My Polish teacher devised that students will make in group of fours  presentations about our obligatory reading. First of all, there will be maximally 20% of people who will read original instead of concise description. No one has time. Secondly, we must search for materials in university libraries, and remember that we are future scientist and doctors, not writers or journalists. We also don't have a time for it. Afterwards, it does not cultivate proper writing nor critical thinking nor cooperation, because we have official bibliography and the only one way of getting positive mark is agreeing with statements contained in Polish literature professors' essays. We don't have a time to copy somebody's else theses. Moreover, every hour spent on this wonderful developing activity is one hour less spent on Biology/Chemistry/Maths/Physics. We have only thirteen months to our final exams which results are essential for applying to university. Every 1% less on this 'matura' exam may lead to situation when there will be someone better than you on the list of fresh students. Everyone has to take exam from Polish (in fact, it's the history of world and national literature with obligatory guessing what might the person making the test want as an answer, as the questions are always vague), English (in Poland other foreign languages are being taught so poorly that almost nobody decides to pass French, German or Russian), Maths on the basic level, all of them only to get minimum 30% and the subjects which are chosen for enrolment and which are important in counting 'points' for university; for us they are expanded levels of Maths, Biology, Physics and Chemistry. Do not even compare it with SATs - they are 'way beyond' them in memorization datas which can be too easily found in special tables. We don't have a time to waste on something which must be taken on only 30% level when expanded things must be passed over 95%. Furthermore, we are young and we need rest. We work until the small hours, writing the text of speeches, making slides and finding quotations and creatively agreeing with authorities. We still grow and working to 1, 2 or 3 o'clock and getting up at 5.30 or 6.00 (no one lives near school, you see, everyone are commuting) is sicked. How can we be productive on important lessons? During day we prefer to do our homework and prepare to the following day. We don't have a time. It is not the first time when such a situation occurs. We cannot just not do this presentation, because the teacher will take umbrage at it (I haven't mistaken the expression, she will really take an offence!) and you will get lower marks from all tests and essays. School regulations? A bunch of printed paper. Student council? Important only at school's feasts. Courts? So, they don't not really work in Poland, the repudiation to your petition would be announced to your grandchildren. Media? Just a joke, they don't have interest in such insignificant affairs, of course until someone's suicide would be convenient for their patron political party. Headmistress? She will say that we must settle it ourselves. It's a normal live in my country: don't seek for justice, there isn't a gram of it between borders. In fact, giving us such a stupid work is an example of malevolence and is in theory forbidden. What do you think is better? A young person who studies a lot about human anatomy and then becomes a good, renowned or just conscientious specialist, or a young person who waste times on making a lecture about some book of some author who is TOTALLY UNKNOWN outside Poland (so he is not so much important, is it) and then wastes his time, angry and frustrated, short before exams and who achieves nothing he has planned before? My country needs scientists, but there are no important contest from scientific subjects which are being awarded with scholarship or money and which are just challenging and enticing students to study more. No, there are always contest for best ugly children blobs and blots, best naive school composition, best plain recitation of poems acted dull and boring as hell or best naive project based on babbling something about how the local history is important, with mixed dates and false conclusions repeated after teacher. If someone really wants to help Poland, he must realise that only the chosen, endowed and talented kids who have read a lot of books and have written reams of texts have the chance to become real erudite persons, humanists. Choosing path of humanistic subjects only because someone doesn't want to learn Maths is more stupid than, for example, getting some important for society occupation like baker. Bakers are truly important and undervalued - they can make really good wholemeal bread and thus lower the rate of colon cancer among citizens, provide important vitamins in their products and so on. For the other hand, someone who have spent 3 years on studying willy-nilly humanistic subjects in high school, taken exams and gone to some marketing or managing or tourism or psychology poor faculty (remember - better are reserved for those kids who were reading books, not descriptions full of mistakes), end with no useful knowledge at all. They have wasted 8 years in total on something which is unnecessary for Poland and doesn't bring them joy or well-paid post (remember, smart kids were... and know they gather profits from this). It's a problem so huge that even European Union had noticed that and gave Poland funds to change that state. Unfortunately, there are no effects at all as I observe it. Our teacher only enlarges this phenomenon, because we all want to adjust the system, to invent new methods which will bring Poland fame, to cure lethal illnesses, to treat patients, to make academic career and to simply improve everyone's everyday live. Now, I want to explain last issue: we don't find this project boring or too difficult. No, it just should not be addressed to us - we can write papers, work on data or read the texts, but not waste so many hours on such stupid affair! Why I have spent my precious time on writing this? Well, I was frustrated so much that I could either publish my opinion somewhere or destroy some common property. I have a great esteem towards collective property, so I had no choice but to write this. Now I feel better. I can return to rewriting and rearranging from 400 pages thick book why Napoleon had the caesarean traits, why he was considered as the Saviour of nations and why Poles loved him so much. And how he was criticised. I have a feeling that after that I will definitely know more about connective tissue, muscular tissue, skeleton and circulatory system and write better the Wednesday test from them. Just wait until I will graduate with an academic degree and make you a prescription of two heroic virtues, one antithesis and four uprisings.\n",

      "textContent--->The 21st Olympic Winter Games are finally open :D Yesterday after school my friend Dorota and me went to the shopping centre. We were talking and eating our favourite ice-cream which are selling only there, despite the fact that Dorota cought a cold. When I returned home I immediately turned on my TV. When I saw a pretty Canadian's landcape and the olympic flag I forgot about everything else. I was watching qualifications to the first ski jumping competition (which will take place today) with a big attention. I've been a big ski jumping fan since 2000 and I know names all of jumpers. :) Results of qualifications satisfy me. All of four Poles jumped long (especially Adam Małysz) and we'll can see them in the fight about medals. Of course I'll be supporting Poles, but the other ones too :D I exactly remember the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight years ago, when I was 10 years old. The Swiss person - Simon Amman won both of competitions - it was a very big surprise (Adam Małysz received the silver and the brown medal). They are likely to fight with each other again, probably the last time on the Olympics (but who knows? Everything is possible. Japanese jumpers are much older than them). During eliminations I started to think about what I should do with the opening ceremony. It was planning on the deep night according to Polish time. I love sleeping and at the first moment I thought: Oh no, I lose this wonderful event... But maybe one minute later I decided to watch it. When qualifications finished I washed and lied down. I was trying to sleep for more than one hour but it was impossible. So I switched on my computer and the radio. Finally I went to sleep at 11.30 pm. I woke up at 3 am and the first thing which appeared on my mind was: There is not as bad as I expect. So I turned on the TV. The opening ceremony was absolutely amazing! It was a meeting with the wonderful culture. Special effects made an enormous impression on me. The mix of views, colours, flames, ice etc. was just beatiful. The main performance with violins, a shade of a person on the yellow Moon, people who were flying, Indians, connected millions of people in front of the TV screens and took them to the mysterious, mystical and colourful world. A crowd of sportsmans from all around the world, who were showing their flags and who were proud of their nations - what an incredible view! Even if we couldn't see some of the biggest stars (for example Adam Małysz and Justyna Kowalczyk weren't there, because of their close starts). I'm always happy to see exotic countries on the Olympic Games. Skiers from Africa - isn't it just great? I recommend you to read about Robel Teklemariam. He comes from Ethiopia and is a skier. http://5dreams.panasonic.net/robel_teklemariam/ << this is his blog. Let's read about his dreams. I'm adding to this post his video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDKbKvJLUEk But we can't forget about the terrible accidant which happen a couple of hours before the opening ceremony. The sportsman from Georgia Nodar Kumaritashvili died. It's so sad and it's hard to stop tears. But I think his dream came true... He was on the Olympics. In 1968 in Grenoble a Pole Stanisław Paczka died in the very similar accident. I must say that the olympic flag is a something very important for me. This is the symbol of coexistence of continents, despite the borders and differences. I prefer version with white circles in the blue background. And wonderful Bryan Adams was singing during the ceremony:D Who will you be supporting during the Olympics? And which competitions are the most interesting for you?\n",

Probably I'll made a lot of mistakes, because my English isn't very good. In my opinion I should learn something more after nine years. Anyway! I'm really cheerful and funny person. I have a lot of sense of humor, but I tend to be rude and mean, if I don't like someone. I'm also ironic, sarcastic, audacious and really arogant (You have no idea...). Some people just afraid of me. Maybe that's because I'm honest person and I'm saying what I think, and truth isn't always the best thing in our lives. I'm also going to high school, in Polish, of course. It's biology and chemistry class, so it's quite hard faculty. Apart from this I'm going to write a book (with my friend) , which will become the biggest world bestseller! Yea! Ok... How you can see - I'm also crazy. Finally I think learning language with lang-8 will be funny and pleasant experience. And right now, one thing I'm doing, is counting down the days to my eighteenth birthday. 20th January I won't be a child anymore... Oh, just ignore the last one...

      "textContent--->Sleeping and waking up at early morning I found a mystery of waking up at early morning. You certain heard in old films, that people were waking up at early morning (when sun arises) and then they were eating breakfast. Why they immediately were eating, why there weren't laying. Answer is simply, beacause they was very hungry and they wasn't able to focus on dreaming or other stuff. When were you hungry at morning? If you aren't hungry at morning, it is unhealthy, because you couldn't eat big breakfast (big breakfast is healthy). Why aren't you hungry at morning? Because you ate before sleeping. I've realised that I get to sleep, when I'm hungry, I will have better sleep and I'll wake up and I won't be laying, I'll have to stand up and go to have a breakfast.\n",

The funniest part of our conversation was pronunciation of polish words :D  (It is really hard to say correctly it if you're not the Pole) I didn't think that there will be to many people from around the world.

      "textContent--->Running I'll be very thankful if you correct it :)  I had always been terrible in sports. In short, I hated sport, psychical education and everything what connects with it. When I was 7 I started school and I couldn't manage with sport lessons - I was weak and I couldn't, for example running fast, catching a ball. I've never been in good form. In May I bought professional sports trainers destined to running. And I started running. Now I'm in the best condition I've ever been and I fell great! I don't feel weak, I have a lot of energy and I think I can do everything :) Today I've run only 30 minutes, but I'm going to run the marathon in the future, maybe next year, who knows? I want to tell one: running is a great fun and makes me happy! When I'm running, I feel free and I think only about surrounding stretch, and it's very funny when people look at you funnily.\n",

      "textContent--->From people have nothing at all to people have-it-all Once upon a time, a man wanted to put his house on sale and buy a new one. He went to one of his friend who was a business man and an expert in marketing. He asked him to help him with writing the announcement for the house sale. This expert new the house very well. So he wrote a detailed description, describing it's beautiful location, large area and it's spectacular artistic design. Then he talked about the huge pool and the garden and how charming they were. After he was done writing the announcement, he read what he wrote to the owner who was listening very carefully. When he was finished, the owner asked him to read it again, and so he did. Then the owner shouted, \"Oh my God! What a marvelous house! \" I've been dreaming for my whole life to have such a great house. I've never realized that I'm living in it until you described it to me. He smiled to his friend and said, \"Please don't publish this announcement. My house isn't on sale any more.\". There is an old saying that says, \"Count the blessings that you have in your life. Write them down one by one and you'll feel much happier than before. \" We complain because there are thorns beneath flowers while what should be doing is to be grateful that there are flowers above the thorns. A man said I was hurt because I had a bare feet. But then I became grateful and  thanked God for that for making me that way when I found that another man didn't have legs. How many people wished to have what you have. Such as; your car, your house, your cellphone, your certificate, your job, your family, your partner... How many people walk with bare feet while you're driving a car? How many people sleep in the streets while you have a home? How many people wish to get a chance to learn while you have one of the best certificates? How many...? How many...? You might not believe that there is such people. The people who walk with bare feet or sleep in the street or can't afford learning. But there are people like that. Besides there are people who are grateful even when they have nothing but crumbs. Isn't it the time for us start being grateful for what we have. So my advice for today is \"Be Grateful\". There is a beautiful touching song that I'd like to share with you. Here it is, I hope you'd like it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6IBdHW_rY\n",
      "textContent--->Friendly places Everyone has his warm place to go when he feels bad. We might find some friendly places such as beaches, own rooms, parks etc. For example when I feel despair on something I'd go to my own room and prostrate in front of Allah and ask whatever I want and then Feel comfortable. Friendly places can decrease the pressure in the person. like when someone thinks about something he goes to the park sitting on the branch and talking to the sea waves. Well known that the sea hides our secrets. friendly places can give you comfortable atmosphere in life, can make you forget all the pains, sadness and bad stuff that happened to you in your life.\n",

      "textContent--->The Egyptian People  And The New Dawn: stories from the revolution Before reading this entry, please make sure that you read the previous one for comprehension and consistency: http://lang-8.com/109061/journals/799106/The-Egyptian-Revolution I know that I promised to tell you how the Egyptians saved their own country. So, I'm writing this entry. The Egyptians keep surprising me and I have a feeling that they're going to surprise me even more in the near future. Let me tell you why I'm grateful to these people: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1) When about 30,000 prisoners ran away from their prison and all the disasters that I talked about in the previous entry happened, people had to protect themselves. Prisoners took many weapons and they used them of course. They would simply knock on the door, the next thing you know is that people are hurt and your apartment was robbed. So here is what Egyptians did to handle this dilemma. All men in every street went down to their street and each one of them got something to use as weapon: thick stick, pipe, gun,... etc. my mom and I found us two sticks and made them ready by the door, just in case. The people who belong to each street would gather from the starting time of the curfew and start their night shift. Some of the people stand at the beginning of the street, some of them at the end and the rest of them wandering in the street. They also put boulders across the street (at the beginning and end of the street) except for about two meters in the middle to allow cars to pass. They would use more borders in the middle if the street was too long. Each car that wants to pass must be inspected carefully by the people standing at this inspection point. They also used signs between them like a whistling if they were suspicious about something, so back up would come immediately from the people who's wandering in the street. Sometimes, they found prisoners, boxes of weapons, stolen things and lots of cash. Once they find anything suspicious, they'd call the military hotline to come and take these people. The best thing about this is that people used not to know their neighbors but after that time that they spent together from about 6:00 pm to 8:00 am, they came to know each other very well. Besides, you never see someone standing to protect his own building or his own family... but he stands to protect the people who are living in the whole street. Egyptians came to know what \" We're all one \" really means. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMdYKY2KHSg ********************************** 2) Some of the prisoners went straight to the museums to steal the precious pieces there. Consequently, some people gathered and went to build human walls around these museums. They were to stay from night to dawn around every museum. If I were to wish for one last thing before I die, I would have wished to see this scene with my own eyes. Another problem faced the people is that there was no traffic man, so some of the people volunteered to do that and you can see that in the previous video. ********************************** 3) You're never going to believe this one. Some people had some serious injuries (most of the injuries were losing one eye or both of them by gunshots. very brutal, I know) because of the police's violence. They'd go to the emergency (it was not exactly a hospital but I'll tell you what it was later) and then get back to the square to continue their mission and to stand with their brothers and sisters who are fighting for freedom. Can you see how precious freedom is for the Egyptian people? I've seen people who have only one leg joined this revolution as well. *********************************** 4) The Egyptian world that was represented in Tahrir Square. Honestly, this needs an entry just to talk about this tiny world but I'll try to be as brief as possible. Tahrir world consisted of one big family that consisted of hundreds of thousand of members. All these people shared food, water and most importantly goal. You would see many people coming in the morning holding huge bags full of bread and other food. When you ask them what this is for, they'd immediately answer that it is for the people in Tahrir Square. They would instantly go in and distribute what they have on these people although they most likely don't know any of these people. They also clean it and sweep the floor of Tahrir Square. *********************************** 5) At hard times, when Muslims were to pray, Christians made a human wall around them so no one would hurt them. That shows that in Egypt Muslims and Christians are one. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEX8dNhZJ60 *********************************** 6) A mosque near Tahrir Square was used as a hospital and hundreds of doctors volunteered to save the injured people. It wasn't a five-star hospital but they used what they had so as to save lives. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoT7ILQHoLI This one is in English: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZN3Y6_s9hs *********************************** 7) Today and after everything was over and Mubarak has finally stepped down. They made a campaign to clean the square and renovate what was broken there. They also agreed to build a memorial for the people who died there and who died all over the country in the same cause. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSo4tOSF9M *********************************** Oh, sorry, I didn't know that I wrote that much. So many miracles happened in the las few days. I could go on for days writing about this. I'm just going to conclude with something that is now said (and most importantly felt) repeatedly among Egyptians: a great Egyptian leader once said \" If I wasn't Egyptian, I would have wished to be one. \" ---------------------------------------------------------- Photo #1: Muslims praying in Tahrir Square. Photo #2: The Cross and The Quran together united to constitute not a Muslim nor a Christian... but an Egyptian. Photo #3: A wedding party that took place in Tahrir Square a week ago. The bride and groom said to the people in Tahrir Square, \"We'd never find a better audience to celebrate our wedding with than you (all protesters).\"\n",
      "textContent--->like stars on earth I have just finished watching this movie taare zameen par.

      "textContent--->My emotion Sometimes we discover our self through troubles and stances. I think I am a calm person but when I engaged in hard talk with my friend, I lost my ability to control my feelings and couldn't say anything and felt my mind and thinking were stopped from working. I know I can express about my feeling with a good manner if I was calm but what I can do with my emotions.\n",
      "textContent--->Freedom is precious. Today is very crucial in the Egyptians` life. Today, all the Egyptians can sleep in peace because Mubarak steped down at last. He declared his decision at six pm. I heard that he left Eygpt, and travelled to Germany. When I heard the decision I felt that I want to cry out fo joy at first, and out of sympathy. At first, I wanted to cry out of joy because the tyrannical authority of Mubarak has fallen, but I wanted to cry out of sympathy because I didn`t want Mubarak to leave Egypt, you know that Mubarak is eighty three, I wanted him to die in his country, at last he is a human being whatever he did. But when I remembered that his wealth is seventy milliar dollar whereas thre are a lot of hungry people in his country I said that he deserves what happened to him because he didn`t merce his people, therefore, he shouldn`t be merced as welll. This is a lesson for every president to know that injustice leads to painful end like Mubarak`s. Eventuially, I want to say that congratulations for all the Egyptians, you have been patiant for thirty years, congratulations for all the youth, men, women, and children who spent more than two weeks in the streets calling for their demands. I want to tell them all I am so proud of you. You are really Egyptians.\n",
      "textContent--->Grammar is my nightmare. Hello everyone. :) My name is Dina. I love English language so much. I learn it at school. Then I try to improve my english skill by watching TV shows, series, and songs. And by making a lot of friendship with people who understand English and not speaking my native language. When I watch talk shows, series, movies I can understand 97% of it. And I can speak english fluently. But my problem is grammar. When I wrote any sentence I become so confused because I'm not sure if what I wrote is have grammatical errors. One of my friends said:\"don't worry, no one care if you have grammatical mistakes or not. even the native speakers make grammatical mistakes\". But I really do care. Actually I'm totally nervous about my mistakes in this entry. >.<\"\n",
      "textContent--->HUMAN CULTURE  My object today is gonna be about human culture or we can say its about things in common between all people around the world . I think one of those things is religion ,and when i talk about religion i do not  mean exact one like being christian , muslim ,buddhist  or any thing else. And i think may be more than 90% of the whole people have their own religion and  this means its very important thing. So the question is why we need religion, i think its because we need some thing  like food for our spirit... actually you can see yourself looking at the sky when you  are sad or needing power from god to help you. At last i think every one of us should have his religion to be comfortable  and to support him in his long life..:) Thank you for reading  and i hope i can see your gladly acceptable comments....;)\n",
      "textContent--->A Day In Transportation In Egypt Transportation in Egypt could be considered as an adventure or a tragedy, especially in Cairo. Anyone who had been to Egypt before can tell why. I think it's more like a sport really, as it consists of two actions: running and hopping. We haven't got to the hardest part yet. When I go out at 7 am, It's almost impossible to find not an empty seat, but an empty aisle in any bus. So, now I have to do the running, the hopping and the standing in the aisle. Now, this is the hardest part. Standing in the -- 30 cm wide -- aisle isn't going to be just standing; it's getting squashed by the people who are trying to get from the back of the bus to the front; it's reeling like drunk people every time the driver hits the break; it's hanging from this rusty iron cylinder like monkeys. To be fair, it isn't always that bad, sometimes a gentleman offers me his seat, and I kindly accept his offer (I can never deny an offer like that?!) I'm not always that lucky, and I don't blame the setting men for that, it's such a hard decision to make. Leaving his seat is like choosing hell over heaven, well, setting on a seat isn't exactly like heaven, but we'll get to that in a second. Where were we? Ah, the lack of gentlemen which was led by the hard and awful circumstances. Enough talking about the aisle people. Let's assume that I got lucky and found an empty seat (in my dreams!). Mostly this seat is going to be an aisle seat, so I'm sandwiched between the aisle person and the person setting next to me (Lets hope that both of them are on a diet). I cannot tell the aisle person to step back just a little bit, because there is no back. Technically, the back is the front, so I wouldn't even dare to ask. And I can't ask the person setting next to me to budge a little bit, because if there was any free space they wouldn't hesitate to do so, instead of sticking to the next person in this hot summer. So, there isn't any way out, is it? I just try to find something to distract me until I get to my destination. I usually read a book or look out of the window trying to notice new things I haven't noticed before. Many might ask why don't I get a car and save myself all the trouble. My answer is three words: car accidents, stupid, impolite drivers and same congestion problem. This was about four hours of my daily routine. Amazing, right? I get to do some exercises and have a ride in a roller coaster, what could be better than that?!\n",

I was supporting Qatar, it is a small country but it has a big ambition to host this event, it has hosted Asian games before and it will host Asian cup next January 2011. I didn't expect Qatar will win and I was surprised too, because Qatar didn't play in world cup before, and people in the world still don't have enough information about it, but this is a chance to present a true picture and the great culture of this area. 12 years seems so long, and I don't know how I'll be at that time, but I wish to go there and support my team and be with people from all over the world.\n",

      "textContent--->How leave happy life.. Some people think that by money you can buy happiness. If that's true why we still see that rich people are suffering from money, why most of them have crimes and gangs. Some poor people find poverty is a grace, they see how some rich people are suffering- paying taxes, insurance life,buying their souls just to serve Gangsters.. etc-. To talk about beautiful life, what should we follow?and who?. beautiful life can be considered as the ideal example to the simple person. simple person is someone who just cares on his family, his work, the God and the guidance from him. Without these we can not live happily. for instance, when you are getting ready to an exam what should you do to get a high grade?. I think not only cramming, but understanding the meaning of what are you studying is more beneficial than that. so first you should reach the point then to start prepare you self through them. Live, play, worship, know your duties and then you will reach the changes.\n",

Yet , this is couldn't help me improving my Japanese , which is weird ! But , I got to get a bit better when i started using Books and websites rather than only listening or watching Japanese shows . However , I'd like to know , how do people use songs to learn .. \" i am just speaking out my thoughts . u may not need to comment on this XD \"  Will post more later now i am going to bed\n",

      "textContent--->Songs Stuck In My Head Do you know when you listen to a song and you feel like this song is going to stick in your head forever? That's what happened to me when I listened to the songs in the videos below. The first song is called \"Hold My Hand\". It's talking about the bad things happening  in the world right now and how sad it is. It says that we'll always be neighbours in this world, so we'll always be stuck with each other, therefore we have to surrender to the fact that we have to be good to each other (I made it sound bad, didn't I? Well, you'll get what I mean when you listen to it). It's using western music with a phrases and topics that we're familiar with, that's why it captured many people's attention. The second song is called \"For the Rest Of My Life\". This song is like the best present a man could give to his wife. I've never felt that the millions of romantic songs around the world have any honesty in them, but this one makes an exception. I really don't know why, maybe because it touches our world more than other songs or maybe because it expresses love in a more sophisticated, delicate and honest way, I don't know. Finally, (which was supposed to be \"first of all\", but I didn't want to start with it so as not to steal the light from the songs) the amazing singer who made these wonderful two songs is Maher Zain. I'm sure the people who have been reading my entries are bored of reading this name. If you don't remember him, let's refresh your memory. He is the Islamic singer living in Sweden. He worked as a music producer with RedOne (a gifted music producer who was fast rising in the music scene in Sweden). RedOne was on the verge of breaking into the big time, going on to work with artists like Akon, Lady Gaga, Enrique Iglesias, Brandy, New Kids on the Block, and Michael Jackson. But Maher's career has taken another turn. He started making his own songs and singing them. He started choosing some topics which might fix some ideas concerning our community. Enough talking! Let's move on to the songs. I hope you enjoy them! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoX0ntFGe5o http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU_VwDousCk&feature=related\n",
      "textContent--->Fencing,lethal,glance off,swift,tedious,renowned,hyenas,hinder,peek There couldn't be such beautifull landscape to meditate on. The sunlight glancing off the broad see... But unimaginably something wrong was happening. I took a peek just around me and guess what 3 Hyenas was just meditating near me . I was frightened. I slapped my cheek to verify whether it was a dream or the truth... But it wasn't a dream . I was afraid from their lethal jaw i knew that it was the end ,this is gonna hinder all my dreams. Suddenly they started speaking : \"What a beautifull landscapes isn't it?\" I was  O__o (hyenas speaking ????? what's going on???) Hyenas:\"Follow us and you will be alright\" I swiftly answered:\" Yes sir \". Then I followed them. they took some secret passage that couldn't be found easily. After walking for one hour. We finally arrived at destination it was the hyenas village,it was very shocking some Hyenas was fencing with their lethal katana you could hear the clashing sound very well it was frightning others were playing karate ,some of them were just doing nothing. Hyenas:\"Move on \" They took me into a temple a magnificient temple with a huge hyenas status over the rooftop. Suddenly when i entered the temple there was some hyenas praying my mind couldn't believe what was happening i had a terrible headache . Again they drove me to another room. The walking was tedious . I was asking where they are taking me? Entered that room again there was a dark staircase. We downed the stairs. At my astonishement i've never saw such a beautiful place there was a big Hyenas sitting on a huge Royal chair it seemed to be their king. He was admiring the landscape that i described while ago i don't know how it could be possible. I was still under the surprise ,suddenly o loud voice was coming from the whole building : wake up ,wake up you are late for your university what are they gonna say you have entered the most renowned university on the city so don't be lazy ... Grrrr it was my mother voice, but i was still in the dream i told to the hyenas bye bye let's continue this script next time it was on the middle of the film and I was the hero ... Suddenly a terrible slap made me wake up like a zombie i smiled and took my way into the daily routine.\n",
      "textContent--->King Abdullah returned to Saudi Arabia. Yesterday, King Abdullah came back from Morocco. He went there for convalescence, after got treatment in the USA. Before about 3 months, he got a healthy problem, they said it’s Herniated disc. So, he went to the USA for treatment. It was the Hajj season when that happened, and we were on vacation for 3 weeks. He gave us one more week, and requested us to ask Allah curing him. When the Hajj finished he delivered a short speech, here is some of what he said: “ I thank all who asked about me, and I thank all Saudis. I say, as you all are fine, I’m fine. I don’t know what is the cause of this problem. But if Allah will, I’ll get well soon. I’m asking Allah to save you all and make you successful. And please, forgive me for not standing up while I’m talking to you. “ His words were so kind, he was like a father talking to his sons and daughters. No wonder why he is called The King of Humanity. He’s also called The Falcon of Arabism. Yesterday, all my way to the university there were welcomed panels for the king, also many buses were posted welcomed stickers. One citizen who works as a taxi driver, heard that the king’s health became better(that was a few months ago), then he offered that he’ll deliver people without any payment until the king come back to Saudi Arabia. He said that he has another work. Thus, no worry about money. ++ The second picture shows the back window of his taxi. ++  When I was searching about a photo of King Abdullah, I found many Photoshop designs for him. A lot of people were congratulated him for being fine. I just realized how much Saudis love King Abdullah. ++ Here is one of those designs. ++\n",

      "textContent--->Quotes: Don't Cry Because It's Over, Smile Because It Happened \"Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.\"  ~ Theodor Seuss Geisel. I was stunned by the positivity of this quote. It's a very beautiful saying, especially, when one say it to the right person, at the right time. Some people just need to hear things like that, not want, but need. Words like this could make a dramatic changes on someone's life. Another quote that one of my friends posted on facebook yesterday was, \"Life is too short to waste time on someone who is unworthy of your love. It's so sad when the right person won't be able to search for you, because you are too busy all your life making the wrong person right for you.\" I think quotes doesn't need to relate to you personally so as you can feel it. Sometimes, it works as an experience that you gain for not making the mistake. \"Those who criticize our generation forget who raised it.\" I've got to agree with this one. When I read this, I thought these are just the words that gown ups need to hear these days. Criticizing our generation became like a daily routine to them. I'll memorize that saying, and next time I see someone criticizing us, I'll shoot them with these words.:) “In order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness, otherwise how would you know when you’re happy?” ~ Leslie Caron. I totally believe in this saying. I tell myself this every time I feel depressed or unhappy. I convince myself that sadness is what makes happiness more sweet. Most of these sayings seem very obvious that I can't believe that I didn't figure them out myself. Well, we call this in Arabic السهل الممتنع. I'm not sure if this expression exists in English or not, but it's literally translated to \"The easy abstainer\". This doesn't seem right (little help in here, John). Anyway, what it means that some things seem so easy when you read them but when you try to imitate them, you can't. This expression is usually used with when we're talking about poetry -- for the same reason --. I'd love to hear more good quotes, so if you have some good ones please post it in here. Thanks.\n",
      "textContent--->The Gum Was the Solution I didn't know that this little rubbery thing was the solution of my problem which I suffered from, since I can remember. The problem was that when I used any media of transportation I got sick, not always. But it became even worse if I tried to read. This really annoyed me, because I had to use the bus every day to go to college. I also had to fulfill the promise that I made to myself which states that I should read a book every week. The only time a day that I get the chance to read was in my way to and back from college. I had two choices, whether to force myself to stay up late to read enough pages so as to finish the book at the end of the week, or I could try to pull it together and keep reading in the two hours and a half that I spend in the bus and fight these fever like symptoms to read as much as possible. The first one was hard to achieve because I always has to get up at 5 or 6 o'clock, and the latter could not also be achieved because I would not be able to concentrate on what I'm reading if I'm feeling sick. Hmm, what a tough decision! I spent few days following the first methods and other days following the second. Until one day, I had a gum in my purse which I found by chance when I had just got into the bus and was trying to find my book. I took the book and the gum out of my purse. I started chewing the gum and reading the book. And for the first time, I didn't get sick at all. I finally found the solution to pull me out of my my misery, I mean my sickness. That was it, from then on, I read every day 20 pages from my book in the bus without feeling anything at all. I just drift away with the story, live in a whole new world, until my stop comes. Then I have to put my dear book back in my purse and chase the dreams out of my head, then come back to reality. I just wish if the bus can take more time so I can read more of my book. But the trip must come to and end and so my dreams, what a pity!\n",

      "textContent--->Confused! We always say that the heart is the source of love, hatred, happiness, sorrow and all the cannot-be-expressed feelings. We say, \"I know it deep inside my heart\". When we have a conflict between emotions, we know that the arena is taking place inside the pumping heart. The arteries seem like a bridle holding a ravaging horse trying to break free of these ties. A broken heart is when people get hurt, which is a something that accompanies the feeling of betrayal or guilt. One could really feel like a dagger has been punched through their heart. I'm sure that you're now thinking, \"what the hell is she talking about? and what does that have to do with being confused?\" I'm going to give you a peace of mind and tell you what is confusing me in a form of a question. If the heart is the bowl that holds all these emotions, why doesn't heart transplants heal the broken hearts?\n",

      "textContent--->Back To Life It's been a long time since I last wrote anything on Lang-8. I will try not to do that again because I really missed everyone here. I finished my exams and summer vacation has started. I realized that the best thing about vacation is anticipating it because once I'm there, it doesn't feel that great and fun. Most of the time I stay indoors because I hate the hot weather. I've always loved staying home and just stay 24/7 on the internet, watching TV or reading, but it's more dull now. It's true that I meat a lot of people online and get the chance to chat about a variety of topics. It doesn't feel like fun any more. I want to go out, I want to see real people -- not that the ones I'm talking to online are not real but I want to socialize. Sometimes, I would stay home for a whole month -- just me and my laptop, which was something I used to enjoy -- but I ended up being like a moving corpse. So, lately I've realized that I can stand the heat but I can't stand this solitary. What I did was that I enrolled in an English Conversation course. It's a very good way to redirect the pent-up energy -- the energy was directed to killing me and now it's directed to socializing, better, don't you think? In this course, we talk the whole time in English, discuss things, do individual and group presentations, watch a movie, listen to a song and read short stories. There are some other things that they told us that they are going to accomplish by the end of this course but I can't recall them. Have you experienced the feeling that I was talking about before (being trapped in your own house and ending up being miserable)?\n",
      "textContent--->Will Smith & Chris Gardner Will Smith & Chris Gardner When you hear those two names, the first thing that should come to your mind is \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" is a movie starred by the great actor Will smith. In this movie Will Smith is impersonating Chris Gardner who was a homeless-divorced father who became a millionaire. This didn't happen over day and night but it happened after a hard struggle with determination. At the beginning of this movie, you can see that he was only hoping for survival as he didn't have any money and he was raising his son all by himself. Even in the darkest times when he was kicked out of his apartment as he didn't have any money to pay the rent. So this ment that he and his son were have to spend the night in the streets... What can a man do when he encounter such a devastating situation? What choices does he have?! I guess not much! Let's see what he did... He and his son were setting on a bench on a metro station. He had this machine with him which was all he had (It's some medical machine he used to sell for living). He told his son that this was a time machine, of course his son didn't believe him at first but then he pushed a button in the machine and started telling him that he's seeing dinosaurs. His son started to cope with him pretenind to be imagining these things too. \"We gotta find some place safe, we need a cave... we gotta find a cave\" Chris told his son, then he took him to the bath room in pretending that this was the cave. After that, he let his son put his head on one of his legs to sleep, blocking the door of the bath room with the other leg. Then, he started crying and of course I couldn't hold the tears in my eyes any longer so I cried with him :(( :(( :(( It was a very touchy moment, actually, the best scene in the whole movie. Anyway,If i'm going to write about this movie according to how much I love it, then it's going to need lots of pages from me to write it and lots of hours from you to read it. Finally, I recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it yet. You're missing a lot if you don't see it. Best of luck everyone!\n",

Anyway this moth is special for me and for all muslims around the world, and for this I scheduled my time to spend it doing worthful and valuable stuff. Such as reading good books and I already chose two books to read, luckily I still read them so far and this my first time to read a huge book like this one which has more than 700 pages.

I did not make amazing designs so far unfortunately :( Actually I think such thing doesn't suit me. Stuff like designing needs someone creative by nature, but that one not me and I'm sure. Sometimes I think that i should give up but other times i think there is a chance for me if I work with extra effort i just need to be patient. ^_^ That's all for today. Hope find someone correct this entry, thanks beforehand. Regards.\n",
      "textContent--->The end of the first step! I did mention before that football is my favorite sports, and the world cup is the most important event for this sport. Today, it was the last match for our national team. After Slovenia and England, we had a game against the USA. Before the world cup begins, I expect a lost against Slovenia; not because they are very strong, but because our team would not feel the competition at the beginning. A win against England and a draw with the US, but after a draw with the British it was obvious that our task is harder than I thought. I saw American's play since 94, and their match against Slovenia,  they had more determination to win than the English. Well, being coaching by a marines explain there determination! Especially on the attack, even that there defense was less effective, but lucky them we didn't had a strong attack, but a strong defense that stand up against Americans attack for more than 90 minutes. In the lasts seconds, after a rebounded ball, the Americans scored. Thought with a draw we would not pass anyway neither with one goal; the Americans had more motivation and they made it. Now I'll continue to watch the world cup with less pressure and enjoy the event :) I thing that Argentina will be the champion this time, how about, what you think? * As always, I have to post some music :) This time it's a music style called Guenawi it's known in south Algeria, Morocco, and Mali they have sort of bohemian style if I may say the singer here is : Amazigh Kateb singing : Les Algériens (Algerians)  Enjoy ;) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWp3VVU0TCE&playnext_from=TL&videos=MS5Cu2BQZB0   \n",

You'll be my eyes and guide. When will you be my wife?\" She said: \"Do I marry to a blind man and I can see now?\" He cried and said: \"Who am I to marry me?

      "textContent--->How Can You Choose the Language That You Want To Learn? I though I would ask the people here that question, then I thought, \"why don't I find it out myself, and then write an entry about it?\" and so I did. Here is a wonderful website I found during my research:  http://www.micheloud.com/FXM/la/la/index.htm This website has some observations of 19 languages that might help to assess if a specific language is what you want to learn. It is very organized and helpful. It also lists some good criterion about language assessment, like: overall difficulty, hours needed for learning each language,  countries speaking them and more other things that certainly will help anyone make a decision. Another cool website which summarizes the most popular languages: http://www.omniglot.com/language/which.htm This website have some other good criterion for language assessment. Some of them are: availability, usefulness... and the most important criteria is languages for demand by employers. The next link is another great languages' research: http://www.cla.purdue.edu/fll/GBL/BackIssue/VOL3/Uber.pdf This research is called Corporate Recruiter Demand For Foreign Language And Cultural Knowledge. Most of the statistics in this research indicates that this is only USA's perspective of second languages demand. I had a quick review of this research, but I'll have a careful reading of it later. I hope this helps you to sort out your priorities of language studying.\n",

      "textContent--->What is the Difference Between Love and Friendship? It means: Can a lover be a friend? And a friend be a lover? The answer is yes! But love and friendship are different. Here is the definition: Friendship cannot end! A friend for a day may still a friend for tomorrow. Unlike love! When love goes, it wont come back. The one who we fall in love with then we forget him, we do not love him again. But friendship is like a tough tree passes all seasons and stay proof if there is someone water it. Love is like a flower with thorns. A flower drinks from two glasses. Friendship can become a love. It usually starts as love. But love cannot turn into friend ship and lover cannot convert to be just a friend. The one who you love you always want him to be yours, but your friend is for everybody. Friendship has levels. It starts from the base and ends in the climax. It begins with number one and finish in infinity. You can find a close friend, a little closer, or a friend who barley can remembered. And the close friend may become a remote one and verse versa. These hypotheses are not existing in the thesis of love. Love cannot be parts and has no levels. It has one level. Love cannot fly except high. You can't love a person then this love will decrease because love doesn't accept the half of solutions. Either it is strong or ends forever.\n",

      "textContent--->Four things you can never retrieve A lady was waiting for her plane at the airport. She was going to wait for a while so she bought a book and a packet of biscuits. She sat down and started reading her book while eating the biscuits. There was a man sitting next to her, reading his own book. Surprisingly, when she took the first piece of biscuit from the packet which was put between her and the man next to her, this man started taking a piece of biscuit from the same packet. With every piece she took, the man took one too. She started to get angry but she tried to control her anger. When there was one piece only left in the packet. She looked at it and said to herself, \"What is this rude man going to do now?\". For her surprise, the man took this piece, split it into two halves, ate one of them and left the other for her. At this moment, she was really mad at him but she didn't say anything to him. She took her book and went to her plane. After she sat down in her seat, she opened her purse to look for her glasses. She did find them, but she also found her packet of biscuits! She was shocked and felt ashame of herself. She realized that her packet was in her purse all the time and the man was generous and kind enough to let her eat from his biscuits and he never complained about it. So she felt even more ashamed and stupid. She was speechless, she couldn't find any convenient words to apologize  to him. So there are 4 things which can never be retrieved. 1- You can't retrieve the stone after throwing it. 2- You can't retrieve words after saying them. 3- You can't retrieve chances after missing them. 4- You can't retrieve time after it passes. So make sure that you act correctly. Don't let chances slip off your hands and don't rush to quick decisions and judgements on others.\n",

      "textContent--->Contradictions of human beings Contradictions of human beings Hypocrite praises you in uproar and cheating you in privacy. Proverbs is a summary of experience launched by anonymous. Divorce is a company went bankrupt after having implemented its  balance of emotions. Secrets are information you disclosed it to others to exploit it against  you when you feel with safety. Rumor is a plan faster than the voice. Cold war is a woman smile to another woman. Anger is a wind blow suddenly then it blows out mind light. Spite is a feeling of inferiority towards others and it transformed  into hatred. Luck is a crutch to unsuccessful person and weapons to victorious. Generosity is a diplomatic need for dealing between people. Patience is a polite way of sufferance prevent the injured from  compliant. Reading is a magic key opens the coffers of treasures to us. Time is a speed train which is impossible to stop it. Surrender is a weakness which leads to humiliation. Eloquence is replying with out slow down and hit without making  a mistakes. Conscience is red sign which stops the human in front of him self  to say the truth with it even for a moment. Smile is the oldest and fastest way for connecting, the human know it. It is also the only language which all people understand it. Longing is a rare metal which expands with heat and shrink with cold. Shyness is a rare moment which allows for a girl to look with a rosy face without powders. Silent is the best conversation between lovers. A good word is a slave bridge that connects the hearts of people over  the sea of selfishness. Life is a ship its fuel is the work and its sail is the hope. Friendship is a profitable business deal between two hearts  and two souls. The teacher book doesn’t teach till the student move it. Hope is a candle which lights up paths full of sadness and fear then  the wish rises. Optimism is a scent garden from roses among the thistle trees. Honor is the only thing that can’t be never lost even if one time. The mother is the only creature that we find her in life with a truthful smile and with a thin anger. Farewell is necessary from it but it is easy to say it but it is more  difficult to hear it. You find between people who are like pebbles and who are like jewelry. The tree is evaluated by its fruits. Only the confidence people who are conceal the secret and the secret by the best people is concealed. Masters of people in the world are the generous and in the hereafter are the pious. The best people who modest about his highness and pardoned about his ability and more equitable about the power. The person who knows the people is smart but the smarter who know himself. Lukman el-hakem said, recommending his son: Son: I never regretted from silence. Son: Retried the evil and it will retried you . the evil is created for the evil. Son: Take the obedience to God is a trade brings you profit without  trade. Son: Don’t sleep and eat more, the person who exceed from them will come bankrupt from good works in the day of resurrection. Son: If you drink from a well don’t throw a stone in it. Son: A bird in you hand is better than a bull in the hand of someone  else. Son: There are two things if you care with them you will not heed after  them with any thing you do . they are your religion for you promised and your dirham for your pension. Son: There is no better than the heart and the tongue if they become good, also there is no bad than them if they corrupt. Son: Don’t side with world or filling up you heart with it . you didn't  create for it. Son: don’t laugh with out wonder and don’t ask about things which  aren't particular for you. Son: attend the scientist with you knee and listen to them with you  own ears because the heart lives by the light of the scientist. Son: I passed on many prophets and I learned several things  from them. If you are in a pray, you must save you heart. If you are in a meeting, you must save your tongue. If you are in people houses, you must save you sight, and if you on food you must save your stomach. finally, there are two things you mustn’t remind them never . they are the harming of people to you and your kindness to the people.\n",

She smiled saying “Amazing, I will change my hair style today, I will  split it to two parts and make a divider in the middle.”  She did that and spent a nice day. On the third day, she wake up and found only one hair in her head. She smiled and saying “Excellent, I will comb my hair to back.” She did this and spent a fun and happy day. One day she wake up and looked in the mirror to find her head free of  hair perfectly. She saying with high voice “That’s amazing, I will not have to comb my hair today.” There is no doubt that there are many problems and obstacles in our life.

I really thank them, and I’ve written this information about Saudi Arabia as one of the Arabic countries. I think that I haven’t talked about this information before. I hope it’ll be interesting. ** There are 13 governmental universities and 8 private ones. Also, there are many colleges and institutes. The largest university is King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Thwal - a city near to Jeddah in the coast of The Red Sea -. This university is only for higher studies. ** Studying in  governmental universities and schools is free. Textbooks are  also free in both governmental and private schools. ** People here use their cars in moving from a place to another. Riding bikes and waking is rare. Each family has at least one car, and if it has old sons this number will increases. Because each son wants to have his own car. That’s why streets here are extremely congested – especially, in Jeddah and Riyadh -. Imagine what would happen if women drive ,too!! It would be a disaster !! ** Arabic coffee and dates are very important in every visiting to any Saudi house. The main two things in making Saudi coffee are ground coffee and cardamom, of course plus water. The other ingredients are different from a region to another or from a tribe to another. The another adds are saffron, ginger, or cloves . Saudi coffee is bitter, you should eat some sweet thing with it. ** The common way in greeting  is shaking hands with cheek kiss (if you haven’t seen the other person for a while or in occasions) or just shaking hands for everyday greeting or with formal people. It’s natural to see people hug and kiss each others in occasions. Like in the two holidays – Eid Al-Fitir and Eid Al-Adha – . After finishing the special prayer, as long as you wake in the streets, you see men hug each others and congratulate for this delighting occasion. - The photo has been taken after finishing the Eid prayer. - I hope those three entries added some new information to your knowledge. I wish that they weren't boring. Thanks for reading. ^__^\n",

They are considered as one of the most important things we should have in our homes. They are in every home. They keep us updated with the world . They are suitable for any age because of their variety programmes. They help to bring all the family together . Televisions also have many advantages and disadvantages. In recent years, televisions have improved greatly. They have a lot of different kinds of models and sizes. They also show a lot of different programmes for children,young people and elders. They can help childern to improve their language skills. For example,they can learn how to talk and understand another language . But sometimes they show bad programmes and that are not good for them. Even with those bad programmes they still watch them. Most of the people spend a lot of time watching them and that is not good for their health. However, they make us feel very happy. they also help us to exchange information and gain knowledge which could not in the past. They make us very comfortable. I think Television is the best invention in the history of the world . It has changed a lot of our habits. We can't live one day without watching it. It helps us to overcome our depression. It makes us feel very glad and comfortable.\n",

Then I felt that I like all Japanese things,and that made me learn more words and sentences. But after some months, I feel bored, then I stopped learning Japanese. Before one year I started learning Spanish, and I found it an interesting language. I still learn more and more in Spanish and that make me happy. Now, when I think about what I did, I find that I just did the right for me. Let me explain, About Japanese: * It has its own alphabet. so, I can't read nor write any thing in Japanese if I don't learn its alphabet, and that is difficult. Even if I use the Romaje, it'll not be useful for me. * I don't have friends from Japan and I can't have. So that I can't practice what I have learned and I'll forget it soon. * It's not an international language, people speak it only in Japan. About Spanish: * its alphabet is the same as English's. so, I can read and write it easily,and easier than English in my opinion, because you write the words as you pronounce it. * I have friends from Colombia and Mexico. I practice my Spanish with them. * Spanish is the forth international language in the world. It is the native language in Spain,  the second language in U. S. A and most countries in the Latin America speak it. It'll be useful for me to learn it.\n",

The wonderful  faces  and the soft hearts  in Gheras make me smile . In Gheras I see my friends ,neighbors and my teachers all of them come to make their summer full of benefits  ,funny and to take the rewards from Allah . I think you will ask me now  : \" what is Gheras center ? \" , it is a summer center and it involves of many good cycles such as  \"Disburden your mind \" it is a religious cycle and it talks  about how to live with safety heart in this big world ,\"Relationship engineering \"  it is a social cycle, it talks about how to elevate your relationship and how to deal with the broken relationship, \"The compass of feeling \" it is a developer cycle  and a lot of cycles. Every cycle cost  40 $ dollars . I and my friends  \" Assel and Maram\" decided to join the disburden your mind cycle . Today the teacher talked  about the please Allah  and fear from Allah. She said : \"please Allah by remember the heavens , the merciful of Allah and so on … And at the same time we need also to remind our self by the fear from Allah . The fear like a whip make the straggles walk in  a straight way \" . Then she talked about the Ramadan  she said : \"now we are in Sha'aban  (the months of the readers Quran ) there are 30 days then the great month  will come so it is better to repair and train our self , to read 2 page at least of the holy book , to pray the night prayer  \".

He gave him the freedom  to marry any girl he likes on condition that she would be a princess. the prince travelled around the kingdom searching for a princess. he met a lot of beautiful girls who said they were from royal families. when he made inquiries, he found out they weren't telling the truth. أe went back to the palace and was very sad because he didn't succeed in finding a suitable wife . his parents were also sad for his failure. the next evening ,there was a terrible storm. The sky was cloudy  and lightening flashed . it was raining heavily. suddenly, they heard a loud knock on the palace door . the solider in  charge of the door opened it. He found a beautiful girl at the door. she was wet and cold . she told him that she was a princess and asked him if she could find shelter in the palace. The soldier took the girl to the queen who wanted to make a sure that she was really  a princess. she ordered the servant to make a bed for her and put a pea under the mattress . her mother had told her that any princess couldn't sleep  if there was a pea under her mattress. The next morning, the queen asked the girl how she slept. The girl complained that she couldn't sleep because there was  something in the bed that made it uncomfortable . the queen was happy to find a beautiful princess in her palace. the princess happily greed to marry the unexpected princess. unexpected story. i think it is not happen in our normal life or it happen but with another shape such as the person search more time for a good wife but in the end he married a girl that he don't expect to married her. it happen also to girls not men only. i say about the meaning of the story not the events.\n",
      "textContent--->I Want To Speak English, For Gods Sake! During my 15 years of learning English, I had never heard a single English teacher who speaks English like native English speakers. They have just created this stupid accent that has nothing to do with any English native speaker's accent. Also, everyone is considering it the official accent. If anyone tries to speak more naturally, they will be considered cocky and just trying to show off. I really don´t know who made these rules. I just want to speak English with someone who is capable of assessing my speaking ability. I don´t want to enroll on any English classes, because mostly they will be a waste of time, just like the last 15 years. I want something more permanent and more reliable. I was thinking about attending some classes in the Faculty of Literature in the English Department. Sometimes, they have some discussions, so I thought it'd be a good place where I can have more fluid conversations, and might help me to think in English. But of course, I will not have much help with the accent. Now, since I took this decision, I have been trying to go there, but every time I intend to do so, something stops me. I really hate it when I'm enthusiastic about something and the circumstances forces me not to do it until I just cool off. Then, I just don't feel like doing this any more. Very frustrating! Any suggestions?\n",

How they think in thier peofessional and personal life and  why all world say about them they are activity,lively and they are an advanced people.

I hope any one tell me about the life in each layer. Finally, I asked my best friend before i wrote this entry  she told me that i'm sure that no one will replay to your question. i think that she is right because i'm sure that if i want to know the right answer to my questions,  i must treat with American people.

      "textContent--->Ramadan Hi! Tomorrow is the first day of Ramadan; which means that I mustn't eat or drink anything all day long, from the dawn till the sunset, and this everyday for a month. I remember the first time I had to do that, it was so difficult and I was so excited when I was allowed to eat!! Actually, it's an amazing month,I learn a lot from it, it makes me know how poor people feel when they are too hungry but can't eat anything even not a little bread, although it's very cheap!! Also, it helps me to control myself : I have food, I really want it, I need it and I'm able to take it but I don't, just because I mustn't and nothing else. So I wonder, if I can do that and other people too; that means that giving up smoking or drinking isn't impossible. What one needs to do so is some strength which could make him control his self and not the opposite. And then, he will feel free and strong enough to decide how to live.\n",

In some other countries, people have already started to fast from today. This is a sacred month in which we are appealed to fast. That means not only to abstain from eating and drinking, but also from commiting sins. Indeed, in Ramadan, we are particularly required to purify our souls and control our deeds and sayings ; which means to avoid bad ones and do heavily good ones. Because during this blessed month, the impact of every deed is amplified, whether it is good or bad. I spent today at cleaning home and I'm ready to welcome Ramadan! رمضان  كريم    \n",

      "textContent--->Can women be leaders? One day, my colleagues and I made a debate about women with my insructor Sara Hassanein. During this debate Dr:Sara asked\"Can women be leaders or not?\". Some of us said\"Yes, women can be leaders.\"while the others like me said\"No, women can`t be leaders at all.\". I am against that because women are not suitable for such a hard job not because they are weak but because they have a lot of tasks that are more important than being leaders such as raising the children up. I think that this the most important job for women specially nowadays. I think women have to think how to be leaders in home not in the country because there is abig difference between the woman who succeeded in leading her home and in raising her children up successfully and between who succeeded in leading a country but failed in leading her own house. In additions, women are not strong enough to bear the burdens of such a difficult job. We have to admitt that we are soft and easy to cry because we are more emotional than men. This my point of view and I am ready to defend it now it`s your turn  to say whether  women can be leaders or not but don`t forget to justify your point of veiw.\n",
      "textContent--->Learning Speaking English On Lang-8 By Audio Recording   Audio recording is a feature that I found in other websites but didn't find it here. It really helped me a lot in correcting my pronunciation mistakes. When I found this feature in other websites, I used them more than lang-8, but at the end of the day, I'd come back here again. For some reason, I don't feel comfotable using any other websites. Maybe because this was the first website I used and it has been with me all the way through my learning process since I started. Anyway, I've seen some people using audio blogs, youtube or any other website to get their friends here listening to them and correcting their pronunciation. My friend, paperdoll, from Malaysia posted here an audio of herself reading an article. Since lang-8 isn't that interactive, those who want to improve their pronunciatoin can post their recording and native speakers can post the corrections in audio as well. Here is the website that my friend used: vocaroo. com. Messages recorded by logged-in users will expire after 6 months. Messages recorded anonymously and without an account will be deleted after 2 months. I guess thats enough to get correcections and responses on the pronunciation.\n",

There are so many talented people from all over the world that share some videos that make me laugh, cry or shocked. I consider all three reactions as good moments, even those that bring tears to my eyes. Crying in this case means you're feeling for someone who you barely know which reminds us of our humanity that might be forgotten sometimes in the rush of our busy lives. As always, I brought some videos but this time they're all from the X Factor. I think they are the best ones that I've seen of this show. I haven't seen much, though.

I need an immediat answers for my questions. I can not believe that happiness can be found in occupying the others, kill their children, and  their women. Where is the beauty of the nature in Palestine, I can not see it due to the smoke of the bombs and the rockets which destroyed everything there. No life without peace which means that the palestenians can not live but they try to survive. The crops in Palestine can not grow because zoinists water them blood. Tombstones shout saying \"that`s enough\", mosques, churches, and temples say \"no more, religions did not say kill people, religions order us to love, respect each others, and live in peace\". We have to co-operate to seek for peace not to seek for destruction. The world let Israel occupy and kill the people in Palestine and if we try to defend them they call us terrorists, is it fair?. I am very sad not because of what happens in Palestine but because I feel as if I am handicapped and I can not do anything for them, but all I want now is to be there and defend this land by myself. Despite what happens there, I am not worried because I never have any doubt that Palestine tomorrow will be free.\n",
      "textContent--->Music Today, I'm in a mood for music! So, I choosed some different style of music, to introduce. First one, is from the south of Algeria. Well, it the music of Touareg. The land of Touareg extend to Mali, Nigeria and Lybia too. The Tergui music is very old and they use very ancient instruments, such as the Imzad. Imzad is an old instrument with one string! and it is reserved only for women! Although, nowaday, the Tergui music uses new instrument such as guitars. here you can see a famous Algerian Tergui singer Nabil Othmani (aka Nabil Othman Bali)  with the American musician Steve Shehan. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_lrLaw2P5E Another group Tergui from Mali this time. The Touareg had lot of trouble in Mali, so they  make some revolutions there in the 60s, 80s and early 90s. The group Tinariwen have members from Mali, but the leader lived most of his life in Algerian Touareg territory after his father was killed in Mali. The songs of the group are in most of them about freedom and revolutions. Here is one their songs that is about one of their battles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRqiqHZhKOM Another style of music, from the east now. The Tunisian mezwed The instrument is  the cousin of the bagpipe but it have a funny shape, you can guess what it's made of. ;)  It's used also in Algeria, but here I'll show the Tunisian one. I think, though, the Tunisian music is close to the east Algerian music,the Tunisian one is  more vibrant! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqvzZPc69LM the sound of the mezwed is different from the Scotish bagpipe, but yet, the Scotish and Celtic music is well employed in traditional Algerian music . Here is a specimen with a group called Mugar. The members are Algerian, Bretons and Scotish. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Oi3ftSDfU&feature=related And among all instruments, the Gasba (the last picture)is the most important in all traditional music in Algeria :)\n",

      "textContent--->Funny: A Loving Husband One day, a husband felt that his wife's hearing is getting weaker. He felt very scared about her losing her hearing. So, he went to consult a doctor about her problem. \"These problems have solutions. But to be more accurate about our diagnostics to her condition, I need you to run an experiment on her,\" said the doctor. \"Stand 40 feet away from your wife, and talk to her in a normal tune. If she didn't respond move closer to her to be 30 feet away and talk to her again. If she didn't respond move closer another 10 feet, and so forth.\" The husband went home. He stood 40 feet away from his wife, and said to her in his normal tune, \"Honey, what do we have for dinner today?\" She didn't answer. So he moved forward 10 feet, and said, \"Honey, what do we have for dinner today?\" And again, she didn't say a word. He kept doing this until he was standing in front of her face to face. He said for the fifth time, \"Honey, what do we have for dinner today?\" \"Sweet hear, for the fifth time I tell you IT'S CHICKEN!\" the wife shouted. Do you get it? It's the husband who had been deaf all along, and not the wife. He just kept asking, not aware that his wife answered his question every single time he asked. While thinking that his wife didn't hear his question, he was the one who didn't hear her answer. So, why do one always tend to think that it's others who have something wrong with them but not oneself? Why is it so hard to believe that sometime it's one's fault, and that one should blame themselves for the mistake, and not anybody else. It seems like passing the blame is easier than facing the truth and taking responsibility for one's actions. If that's proves anything, then it proves that the strong one is the one who is able to take the blame for their own mistakes, admit them and face them. That's just my opinion.\n",

If I take King Fahd as an example, there are King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, King Fahd International Airport, King Fahd Medical Complex, King Fahd Amusement park…. etc. And in every city, there is a road called ‘King Fahd Road’. The similar thing is with the other kings’ and princes’ names. ** Most of the craft workers like plumbers, carpenters, electricians, builders,…etc, also petrol attendants, nurses are foreigners. They are from: India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yemen, Indonesia and Philippines. To be honest Saudis are spoiled, they want to work only in offices. Very few of Saudis work in craft works. ** All shops have to close at the time of each prayer (five times a day). And then open again after the prayer finishes (that takes about 15 minutes). When they do that, no acceptable reason will be for people not to pray at time. Shops won't make them busy from performing the prayers. ** The highest tower in Saudi Arabia is The Tower of Makkah’s Clock. Its total high is 601 m, It’s located in Makkah, In front of the Holy Mosque. They haven’t finished it yet, but they're working very fast. The second highest towers are Al-Mamlakah Tower (300 m) and Al-Faisaliah Tower ( 266 m). Both of them are in Riyadh(the capital). - First picture shows Makkah's Clock Tower. Notice the difference in high between the tower and the two minarets of the Holy Mosque( each one is 89 m). The second picture shows Al-Faisaliah Tower (the nearest one) and Al-Mamlakah Tower. - == To be continued ^^ ==\n",
      "textContent--->Translation Yesterday I was too bored so I went to a bookshop for a change. There, I found an Arabic novel for an author that I used to read his stories when I was at high school, so I thought I would buy it. The following is direct translation of the first few pages in that novel. Is the following English correct? ***** Salwa's pulse raised sharply as she was running through huge flat area, in a bizarre world. There was no place she could hide... There were only big mountains at the visible horizon, that had glittering green color, under bloody red sky. The land which she was running on was more flabby than the land she get used to at her world. A creepy creature appeared far away behind her, and started chasing her savagely and persistentｌｙ. A creature that she never saw in her world at all... She wished that this was just a dream Or even a nightmare Anything she could wake up from to find herself again in her real world, that she knew and got used to. Although it was strange world, it was real... A very creepy reality... The land started to quake under her feet... The more that that creature approached her, the more that the land was shaking... And Salwa stopped running! She did not know where she could go or hide, so she just stopped, and screamed: \"Nuur, where are you?\" She was wondering where her husband might have gone, as her screams echoed around, even though she was in a middle of huge empty space. Where did Nuur go? They were together when they were forced to come to this creepy world... They were together all the time, until that last battle... She lost him after that battle... She does not even know where he went, or how he disappeared And so, she is now alone, Doomed, And lost. The gigantic was still running towards her in incredibly fast speed... ****\n",

      "textContent--->The last speaking assessment :D My English exam will be on Saturday. It’ll be the last time I take English, and I won’t study any English courses anymore. The speaking assessment will be on Sunday. From the beginning of this level they asked us to chose any issue to make a dialogue or role-play about it. Then we had to write the conversation we’ll say and gave it to the teacher. So, we’ll have  enough time to practice and memorize our roles until the time of the assessment. I chose to make a dialogue about chocolate with one of my friends. Role-play seems to be a bit difficult. We have to act if we chose it, and I’m so bad in acting :S I wrote the scenario myself. It’s acceptable to get information from any source, but you have to write it with your own words. I’ve already gave the script to my teacher, but she said that she won’t focus much in grammar because speaking and pronouncing is more important. However, I want to know my mistakes in order to avoid them next time. After we finish the dialogue we’ll give the teacher and the classmates chocolate. Here is the conversation, I’ll be girl B ^__^ I didn’t make it long because they said that we’ll take only 2-3 minutes. A- Hi! How are you? B- Pretty well. And you? A- Well. I bought this for you. B- Oo, thank you. It’s my favorite kind of chocolate. I mean I love all kinds, but this one has a special place in my heart. A- You know? I’ve read that eating chocolate calm and reduce worries and stress. B- Yeah, I always eat it when I’m angry or not in a good mood. It changes my mood immediately. It’s very useful in such these cases, believe me. A- So, you eat it a lot. Because as I know you are a moody person. And that isn’t a good thing. Chocolate is full of fats and that may help in acne appearance. B- Ooo, don’t worry. I’ve been eating it since I’ve known myself and nothing happened. Also, I’ve heard that the more chocolate you eat, the longer  you live. A- How interesting! But why the wonder? It lowers the blood pressure. Especially, the dark one. Plus, It provides a lot of energy and makes people happy. That’s why it may increase the person’s age. B- I agree with you. However, you won’t believe the new information I read yesterday. It says that some animals, like dogs, can’t eat chocolate. And if so, they’ll be sick. A- Woow, that’s new for me. I also knew that eating a large amount of it  makes the breathing problems worse. B- hmm, but don’t forget that it helps in reducing the wrinkles, and gives more beauty as the medical magazine said. It’s a convincing reason to not even think of stop eating it. Am I right? A- Surely, I can’t imagine my life without chocolate. B- Me too. And I don’t want to imagine such a terrifying thing like this. I don’t know why, but each time I think of that day I feel nervous and worried. I’m confident with my pronunciation, and in the last assessment I got the full mark. Maybe I’m not confident with myself :’( I mean, standing in front of all classmates and talk always makes me nervous. I’ve tried to persuade myself that I can do it, it’s easy, my English is better than some of them, so why I’m worried?!! But my attempts always fail, and I can’t stop those frustrating feelings. Pleaaaase friends, pray for me (crying face)\n",
      "textContent--->Dignity I have all my dignity. So, I'm Okay. My dignity is as important as my life. My favorite animal is the horse. Do you know why? It's because when looking at it, I don't feel I'm looking to an animal,I rather feel I'm dealing with a noble being. While being in trouble, I usually look at the sky to destress myself. I feel then the greatness of being high. I know that everything will come to an end, but the sky will still be there, very high, as usual. So I calm down and deal with things without losing a bit of my dignity.\n",

Realmente, creo que hay muy pequeñas diferencias entre los dos. Muchas palabras del español son prestadas de inglés. Los hablantes de inglés pueden entender la idea general de un artículo fácilmente incluso si sabían nada de español. Ellos no tienen que memorizar muchas palabras nuevas. El único problema que encuentran con estudiar español es la pronunciación. Sólo dos diferencias que pordía notar entre la pronunciación del inglés y del español. Ellas son la ¨r¨ y la ¨l¨. La ¨r¨ es más fuerte en español que en inglés. Pero, la ¨l¨ es más mimada en inglés que en español. Eso es sólo mi opinión.\n",

Its a plate made basically from breads that we crumbled and irrigated with chicken broth and decorated with eggs. And we prepare a lot of sweet foods, the most common is \"Bradj\" it's a lozenge cookie filled with a paste dates! its tasty and healthy :) But the most important ( as my mother told me, because it was back in her village a decades ago) in this celebration are the children; they all ware the nicest cloths, the girls decorate there cloths with flowers, and they play and run on the green fields that was covered by the snow all the winter.
